AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building.  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad "" The Union Connecting"".  Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations.  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout.  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces.  Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled.  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort.  The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.  This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ.  They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time.  The space?  Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City.  Here the layout was built.  It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa.  It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap.  During the early-1950s the organization moved to its current location in Carlstadt, New Jersey.

Title: History of rapid transit
Body: Rapid transit first began in London with the opening in 1863 of the Metropolitan Railway, now part of the London Underground.  However, smoke from steam engines collected in the tunnels, leading to an uncomfortable passenger experience.  Between 1863 and 1890, there were numerous proposals to build pneumatic or cable-hauled railways in London to overcome this problem, but none proved successful.  Smoke was less of a problem in steam-hauled elevated railways, the first of which opened in New York City in 1870.

Title: Desert kite
Body: Desert kites are constructions aimed at trapping game animals, found in the Middle East.  Known to the local Bedouin as the Works of the Old Men, are found across the deserts of Syria, Jordan, Southern Israel and Saudi Arabia.  They are believed to have been used for hunting wild animals and consist of long dry-stone walls converging on a neck which opens into a confined space which was used as the killing floor.  The length of the walls can run to hundreds of metres and can be best seen from the air.  They were given their name by pilots who first saw them from the air in the 1920s.  Almost 2,000 have been identified across Jordan and Syria.  No research has been done across the Saudi Arabian Desert.  Modern research has proven that the ""desert kites"" were mainly used for hunting herds of migrating goitered or Persian gazelle, a species which became extinct in Southern Levant during the 19th century.  Most desert kites have been dated through scientific methods to be between 3 and 5 thousand years old.  The claim of older ages (8 to 9 thousand years) has been contradicted by more recent studies.  Younger dates mean that the mass hunting did not occur in prehistory and was not done by hunter-gatherers, but during a later period, by agriculturalists who were already growing most of their food.  Rock art in the vicinity of some of the kites indicates that the hunt could represent a large social effort, done together by people from several settlements, and showing religious connotations.

Logs two feet or more in diameter are seen at several places along the trail where it is eroding from the conglomerate capping the mesa.  This conglomerate lies near the top of the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation.  The wood is multicolored (mostly red, yellow, white, and black) and was prized by hobbyists before the Park was established.  The logs are believed to be of conifers that were transported by a river before being buried and later fossilized as agate.  A 50 foot (15m) log is displayed near the trail head and is one of the most complete fossil logs known from the Morrison Formation.

Title: African-American bookstores
Body: African-American bookstores, also known as black bookstores, are bookstores owned and operated by African Americans.  These stores often, although not always, specialize in works by and about African Americans and their target customers are often African Americans.  Although they are a variety of African-American business, African American bookstores have often been closely tied to radical political movements including Marxism, Black Power, and pan-Africanism. The first documented African-American bookstore was established by the abolitionist David Ruggles in 1834.  One of the earliest African-American bookstores to achieve national prominence was Lewis Michaux's National Memorial African Bookstore, which operated in Harlem from the early 1930s to the middle of the 1970s.  Michaux's store doubled as a meeting place for black activists, including most famously Malcolm X.  The Black Power movement embraced black-owned bookstores in the 1960s and '70s as vehicles for promoting their ideology and creating radical political spaces in black communities across the United States.  By the 1990s, African-American bookstores earned significant attention from more politically moderate and business oriented media outlets such as the magazine Black Enterprise.  In the 2000s and 2010s, however, as independent bookstores of all kinds declined and bookstores chains and Amazon increasingly sold black-authored books, the number of African-American bookstores declined rapidly, dropping from over 250 to just over 70.

Title: Black Power movement
Body: The Black Power movement was a political movement to achieve a form of Black Power and the many philosophies it contains.  The movement saw various forms of activism some violent and some peaceful, all hoping to achieve black empowerment.  The Black Power movement also represented socialist movements, all with the general motivation of improving the standing of black people in society.  Originated during the Civil Rights Movement, some doubted the philosophy of the movement begging for more radical action, taking influences from Malcolm X.  The cornerstone of the movement was the Black Panther Party, a Black Power organization dedicated to socialism and the use of violence to achieve it.  The Black Power movement developed amidst the criticisms of the Civil Rights Movement in the early 1960s, and over time and into the 1970s, the movement grew and became more violent.  After years of violence, many left the movement and the police began arresting violent actors in the movement.

Title: Loan modification in the United States
Body: Loan modification is the systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates, monthly payments or principal balances.  Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called ""Great Recession"" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created ""Watch Dog"" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.

Good examples of the Bungalow, Foursquare, Tudor Revival, and Queen Anne styles are present, as well as older traditional vernacular classifications such as the I-house.  These older forms are supplemented by a handful of post-World War II era structures.  Woodwardville also features several public or commercial buildings including a church, a former schoolhouse, the ruins of a store and storage or service buildings associated with the railroad.  Many of Woodwardvilles' older buildings fell into decline following World War II, but in recent years, due to its close proximity to commuter rail service, Woodwardville has evolved into a bedroom community for persons working in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.  Investment by new residents resulted in the restoration and renovation of many buildings which had formerly been in deteriorating condition.  Despite the intense development a few miles away in Piney Orchard, this quaint community retains its ability to communicate its historic qualities and distinct sense of place.

Title: Barbara Macdonald
Body: Barbara Anne Macdonald (""nee"" Charles, September 11, 1913 – June 15, 2000) was a social worker, lesbian feminist and ageism activist.  Macdonald believed that ageism was a ""central feminist issue"" and made it the core of her activism.  At the time, she was a ""lone voice"" fighting against and talking about ageism.  Macdonald felt that ageism divided women and that the stigma of aging became a trap.  In addition, Macdonald felt that defining women by their familial roles was the central contributor to ageism.  She felt that older women tend to be seen as caretakers and mother-figures instead of as individuals.  Macdonald used her anger to fuel her activism and through her anger, she identified many aspects of age-related issues that affect older women, such as poverty, physical challenges caused by age, violence against older women, and health issues: all of which she felt were not adequately addressed by younger feminists.  Macdonald's activism inspired the formation of the group Old Lesbians Organizing for Change, which works in the United States to fight ageism.

Title: Manfred Müller (footballer)
Body: Manfred Müller (born 28 July 1947) is a German former footballer who played as a goalkeeper.  Müller began his career with Schwarz-Weiß Essen, before moving to Wuppertaler SV in 1971.  Wuppertal immediately earned promotion to the Bundesliga, and finished a surprising third in their first season in the top-flight.  The title challenge was not to repeated, however, and the club struggled against relegation in 1973–74, and dropped down the following year.  After Wuppertal's failure to bounce back in their first season, Müller left, moving south to in 1976 to join 1.  FC Nürnberg.  In his second season at Nürnberg, they won promotion, beating Rot-Weiss Essen in a playoff, only to be relegated the following year.  Müller was on the move again, and after a brief spell at ESV Ingolstadt, moved on to Bayern Munich, ostensibly as cover for Walter Junghans.  He did, though, manage a few decent runs in the first team, including an appearance in the 1982 European Cup Final, but eventually lost his place to the incoming Jean-Marie Pfaff, before retiring in 1984.  He returned to 1.  FC Nürnberg as general manager, and made a surprise return to action in November 1986, starting a Bundesliga fixture because of an injury to Andreas Köpke.  He now runs a television production company.

Title: Mendocino County GMO Ban
Body: Mendocino County, California, was the first jurisdiction in the United States to ban the cultivation, production or distribution of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  The ordinance, entitled Measure H, was passed by referendum on March 2, 2004.  Initiated by the group ""GMO Free Mendocino"", the campaign was a highly publicized grassroots effort by local farmers and environmental groups who contend that the potential risks of GMOs to human health and the ecosystem have not yet been fully understood.  The measure was met with opposition by several interest groups representing the biotechnology industry, The California Plant Health Association (now the Western Plant Health Association) and CropLife America, a Washington-based consortium whose clients represent some of the largest food distributors in the nation, including Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical.  Since the enactment of the ordinance, Mendocino County has been added to an international list of ""GMO free zones.""  Pre-emptive statutes banning local municipalities from such ordinances have now become widespread with adoption in sixteen states.

The project's cost was $43 million.  Of that amount, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) contributed 80-90 percent of the project cost.  KDOT and MoDOT shared the remaining cost.  The system employs a system of electronic boards placed on major highways throughout the metropolitan area that display traffic information whenever information needs to be displayed (due to an accident, lane closure, highway closure etc.), and the system also has cameras on those billboards to automatically detect traffic problems.  While the system has extensive coverage of highways in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area it still has much more to cover.  Since it would be too expensive to cover all the major highways in the Kansas City metro (which has more miles of highway per person than any other metropolitan area in the United States), studies were conducted to determine which highways or segments of highways have priority due to higher accident rates.  Since the project's beginning, it has expanded greatly, and will continue to expand.  Future plans are to extend coverage to I-635 and cover I-435 even more (especially in the northern areas of the metro) as well as other major city highways.  It was named after the iconic Kansas City Scout Statue that exists in Penn Valley Park, overlooking Downtown Kansas City.

Title: Bert Coan
Body: Elroy Bert Coan III (born July 2, 1940 in Timpson, Texas) is a former American football player.  He is most notable because of his extraordinary speed (9.4 in the 100-yard dash) and size (6'4"", 215 lbs) and because he was the central figure in a dispute over the 1960 college football game between the University of Kansas Jayhawks and the University of Missouri Tigers, the second-longest-running rivalry in college football (known as the ""Border War"").  Coan played for Kansas - and helped the Jayhawks win the 1960 game by a score of 23-7 over Missouri, then-ranked #1.  But later, the Big Eight declared Coan ineligible, due to a recruiting violation by Bud Adams while Coan was still at Texas Christian University (TCU) and forfeited the game to Missouri—thus erasing Missouri's only loss on the field that year.  Missouri counts the 1960 game as a win by forfeit, thus giving it the only undefeated and untied season in school history.  The Big Eight also credited the 1960 game to Missouri.  However, Kansas (and the NCAA) count the game as a Kansas victory.  Ever since, the two universities have disputed the overall win-loss record in the long-running series.

Natives of the Gilbert Creek region of southern West Virginia, Cousin Ezra, along with brothers Ireland (Lazy Ned) and Curly Ray Cline, were part of the original Lonesome Pine Fiddlers from about 1938, a group that worked on radio at WHIS Bluefield, West Virginia.  During World War II, Ned was killed in action.  When the Pine Fiddlers resumed regular daily broadcasts, Charlie, who played multiple instruments, joined them on a regular basis.  Charlie returned to the Fiddlers briefly before becoming a member of Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys.  During 1952-1955, Charlie worked off and on with Monroe, recording some 38 songs, all on Decca.  It has been said that he played every instrument at one time or another in the Monroe group except mandolin.  Charlie spent most of 1953 back with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers working at WJR radio in Detroit.  When Ezra brought the band to Pikeville, Kentucky, in November, Charlie rejoined Bill Monroe.  In 1954, Charlie did a session, playing lead guitar, with the Stanley Brothers and also another one on RCA with the Fiddlers, although he was not otherwise working with them at the time.  He also worked briefly as a sideman with the Osborne Brothers, although he did not record with them.  By 1958, Charlie (electric lead guitar) and his wife, Lee (electric bass), had rejoined Ezra and Curly Ray in the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, who were experimenting with a more modern sound and working a TV show in Huntington, West Virginia, in addition to daily radio in Pikeville.  In his later years, Charlie was with the Stanley Brothers.  Curly Ray also played with the Stanley Brothers at a different time as their fiddler.  Curly Ray was one of the best fiddlers in Bluegrass.  This most talented family of musicians were the best, surpassed by none.  Finally, on October 1, 2009, The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers got their due when they were inducted into the International Bluegrass Hall of Fame at the Ryman Theater (the original home of the Grand Ole Opry).  Bobby Osborne, Melvin Goins and Paul Williams were there to receive the bands award.  In the crowd of a sold out theater was the son of Ezra Cline, Scotty Ireland Cline, who recalled being in that same theater as a child sitting on stage and watching the Fiddlers play.  (At the time, the Opry had bleachers for family just off stage).  The final act of the evening at the IBMA Awards was the playing of ""Pain in my Heart"" by Osborne, Goins and Williams along with a Song from the Dillards, who were also inducted the same evening.

Title: Loan modification in the United States
Body: Loan modification is the systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates, monthly payments or principal balances.  Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called ""Great Recession"" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created ""Watch Dog"" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.

Title: Whole life insurance
Body: Whole life insurance, or whole of life assurance (in the Commonwealth of Nations), sometimes called ""straight life"" or ""ordinary life,"" is a life insurance policy which is guaranteed to remain in force for the insured's entire lifetime, provided required premiums are paid, or to the maturity date.  As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies.  Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term.  Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age.  The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid-up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65.  Whole life insurance belongs to the cash value category of life insurance, which also includes universal life, variable life, and endowment policies.

Title: Maxine's Tap Room
Body: Maxine's Tap Room is a historic bar in Fayetteville, Arkansas, located on 107 N. Block Ave. It is one of the oldest bars in Northwest Arkansas.  Marjorie Maxine Miller opened the bar in 1950 when she was 24 years old with money she borrowed from her parents.  She managed to pay her parents back within the year.  In 1960 she tore down the old wooden building in which the bar had been located and had the current building—a long, narrow brick structure—built in its place.  The new building had only one window, exactly 8.5 in by 40 in , in the front, which was the minimum size allowed by the building codes at the time.  This was more than likely a business decision aimed at limiting break-ins.  Other examples of Miller's shrewd business style include keeping a club behind the bar, having only a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees so the team would follow as patrons, a business style that led to the bar's longevity and success.  Adding to the Tap Room's charm were a 50 ft -long bar that stretched nearly the entire length of the building and dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box that still played 45s, and a deer head adorned with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses and a tie.  Miller was a constant figure behind the cash register for 50 years until her health started to decline around 2000.  She died at age 82 in May 2006.  A month later the Tap Room caught fire.  Due to lack of insurance the bar was closed for over a year, reopening in August 2007.  Most of the furniture inside the bar was replaced, including the bar.  The exposed rafters darkened by the fire were simply painted black, and a skylight was installed where the roof had burned through.  Considerable efforts were made to retain many things that had been in the bar for a very long time, such as the older lights and signs.

Title: Water supply and sanitation in Algeria
Body: Drinking water supply and sanitation in Algeria is characterized by achievements and challenges.  Among the achievements is a substantial increase in the amount of drinking water supplied from reservoirs, long-distance water transfers and desalination at a low price to consumers, thanks to the country's substantial oil and gas revenues.  These measures increased per capita water supply despite a rapidly increasing population.  Another achievement is the transition from intermittent to continuous water supply in the capital Algiers in 2011, along with considerable improvements in wastewater treatment resulting in better water quality at beaches.  These achievements were made possible through a public-private partnership with a private French water company.  The number of wastewater treatment plants throughout the country increased rapidly from only 18 in 2000 to 113 in 2011, with 96 more under construction.  However, there are also many challenges.  One of them is poor service quality in many cities outside Algiers with 78% of urban residents suffering from intermittent water supply.  Another challenge is the pollution of water resources.  There has also been insufficient progress concerning reuse of treated water, a government priority in this dry country.

Another 100 mostly small municipalities provide services directly without having a legally of financially separate entity for water supply.  Water is not scarce in Belgium and water supply is generally continuous and of good quality.  However, wastewater treatment has long lagged behind and Brussels only achieved full treatment of its wastewater in 2007.  In 2004 the European Court of Justice ruled condemning Belgium's failure to comply with the EU wastewater directive, and the ruling has not been fully complied with so far.

Title: L'Orfeo discography
Body: These lists show the audio and visual recordings of the opera ""L'Orfeo"" by Claudio Monteverdi.  The opera was first performed in Mantua in 1607, at the court of Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga, and is one of the earliest of all operas.  The first recording of ""L'Orfeo"" was issued in 1939, a freely adapted version of Monteverdi's music edited by Giacomo Benvenuti, given by the orchestra of La Scala Milan conducted by Ferrucio Calusio.  In 1949 the Berlin Radio Orchestra under Helmut Koch recorded the complete opera, on long-playing records (LPs).  The advent of LP recordings was, as Harold Schonberg later wrote, an important factor in the postwar revival of interest in Renaissance and Baroque music, and from the mid-1950s recordings of ""L'Orfeo"" have been issued on many labels.  Koch's landmark version was reissued in 1962, when it was compared unfavourably with others that had by then been issued.  The 1969 recording by Nicholas Harnoncourt and the Vienna Concentus Musicus, using Harnoncourt's edition based on period instruments, was praised for ""making Monteverdi's music sound something like the way he imagined"".  In 1981 Siegfried Heinrich, with the Early Music Studio of the Hesse Chamber Orchestra, recorded a version which re-created the original Striggio libretto ending, adding music from Monteverdi's 1616 ballet ""Tirsi e Clori"" for the Bacchante scenes.  Among more recent recordings, that of Emmanuelle Haïm has been praised for its dramatic effect.  The 21st century has seen the issue of an increasing number of recordings on DVD.

Title: Symphony in C (Bizet)
Body: The Symphony in C is an early work by the French composer Georges Bizet.  According to ""Grove's Dictionary"", the symphony ""reveals an extraordinarily accomplished talent for a 17-year-old student, in melodic invention, thematic handling and orchestration.""  Bizet started work on the symphony in C major on 29 October 1855, four days after turning 17, and finished it roughly a month later.  It was written while he was studying at the Paris Conservatoire under the composer Charles Gounod, and was evidently a student assignment.  Bizet showed no apparent interest in having it performed or published, and the piece was never played in his lifetime.  He used certain material from the symphony in later works, however.  There is no mention of the work in Bizet's letters, and it was unknown to his earlier biographers.  His widow, Geneviève Halévy (1849–1926), gave the manuscript to Reynaldo Hahn, who left it along with other papers to the archives of the conservatory library, where it was found in 1933 by Jean Chantavoine.  Soon thereafter, Bizet's first British biographer Douglas Charles Parker (1885–1970) showed the manuscript to the conductor Felix Weingartner, who led the first performance in Basel, Switzerland, on 26 February 1935.

Title: Carmen Suite (ballet)
Body: Carmen Suite is a one-act ballet created in 1967 by Cuban choreographer Alberto Alonso to music by Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin for his wife, prima ballerina assoluta Maya Plisetskaya.  The premiere took place on 20 April 1967 at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow.  The music, taken from the opera ""Carmen"" by Georges Bizet and arranged for strings and percussion, is not a 19th-century pastiche but rather ""a creative meeting of the minds,"" as Shchedrin put it, with Bizet's melodies reclothed in a variety of fresh instrumental colors (including the frequent use of percussion), set to new rhythms and often phrased with a great deal of sly wit.  Initially banned by the Soviet hierarchy as ""disrespectful"" to the opera for precisely these qualities, the ballet has since become Shchedrin's best-known work and has remained popular in the West for what reviewer James Sanderson calls ""an iconoclastic but highly entertaining retelling of Bizet's opera.""

Title: Roma Symphony (Bizet)
Body: The Symphony in C ""Roma"" is the second of Georges Bizet's symphonies.  Unlike his first symphony, also in C major, which was written quickly at the age of 17, ""Roma"" was written over an eleven-year span, between the ages of 22 and 33 (he died at age 36).  Bizet was never fully satisfied with it, subjecting it to a number of revisions, but died before finishing his definitive version.  All four movements were performed in his lifetime, but never all on the same occasion.  The full symphony in its latest revision was premiered in 1875, after his death.  It is perhaps because of Bizet's dissatisfaction that the work is often said to be ""unfinished"".  However, in the form in which it exists today, it is a complete work and is fully scored.  It has been recorded a number of times but is not often heard on the concert platform.

Title: L'Arlésienne (Bizet)
Body: Georges Bizet composed L'Arlésienne as incidental music to Alphonse Daudet's play of the same name, usually translated as ""The Girl from Arles"".

Bizet's music consists of 27 numbers (some only a few bars) for voice, chorus, and small orchestra, ranging from short solos to longer entr'actes. Bizet himself played the harmonium backstage at the premiere performance.

Title: Giacomo Benvenuti
Body: Giacomo Benvenuti (16 March 1885, Toscolano — 20 January 1943, Barbarano-Salò) was an Italian composer and musicologist.  He was the son of organist Cristoforo Benvenuti and studied at the Liceo Musicale in Bologna under Luigi Torchi (musicology) and Marco Enrico Bossi (organ).  In 1919 his collection of songs for voice and piano accompaniment, ""Canti a una voce : con accompagnamento di pianoforte"", was published in Bologna.  In 1922 he published a collection of 17th-century art songs entitled ""35 Arie di vari autori del secolo XVII"".  Composer Samuel Barber studied the works of Giulio Caccini, Andrea Falconieri, and other early Italian composers under his tutelage in Milan in 1933-1934.  For the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma he adapted Claudio Monteverdi's ""L'Orfeo"" for a production which premiered on 27 December 1934.  The adaptation was later used for the first recording of ""L'Orfeo"" in 1939, which included a performance by the orchestra of La Scala Milan under conductor Ferrucio Calusio.

Title: Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria
Body: Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (SV 325, ""The Return of Ulysses to his Homeland"") is an opera consisting of a prologue and five acts (later revised to three), set by Claudio Monteverdi to a libretto by Giacomo Badoaro.  The opera was first performed at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice during the 1639–1640 carnival season.  The story, taken from the second half of Homer's ""Odyssey"", tells how constancy and virtue are ultimately rewarded, treachery and deception overcome.  After his long journey home from the Trojan Wars Ulisse, king of Ithaca, finally returns to his kingdom where he finds that a trio of villainous suitors are importuning his faithful queen, Penelope.  With the assistance of the gods, his son Telemaco and a staunch friend Eumete, Ulisse vanquishes the suitors and recovers his kingdom.

Title: L'Orfeo discography
Body: These lists show the audio and visual recordings of the opera ""L'Orfeo"" by Claudio Monteverdi.  The opera was first performed in Mantua in 1607, at the court of Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga, and is one of the earliest of all operas.  The first recording of ""L'Orfeo"" was issued in 1939, a freely adapted version of Monteverdi's music edited by Giacomo Benvenuti, given by the orchestra of La Scala Milan conducted by Ferrucio Calusio.  In 1949 the Berlin Radio Orchestra under Helmut Koch recorded the complete opera, on long-playing records (LPs).  The advent of LP recordings was, as Harold Schonberg later wrote, an important factor in the postwar revival of interest in Renaissance and Baroque music, and from the mid-1950s recordings of ""L'Orfeo"" have been issued on many labels.  Koch's landmark version was reissued in 1962, when it was compared unfavourably with others that had by then been issued.  The 1969 recording by Nicholas Harnoncourt and the Vienna Concentus Musicus, using Harnoncourt's edition based on period instruments, was praised for ""making Monteverdi's music sound something like the way he imagined"".  In 1981 Siegfried Heinrich, with the Early Music Studio of the Hesse Chamber Orchestra, recorded a version which re-created the original Striggio libretto ending, adding music from Monteverdi's 1616 ballet ""Tirsi e Clori"" for the Bacchante scenes.  Among more recent recordings, that of Emmanuelle Haïm has been praised for its dramatic effect.  The 21st century has seen the issue of an increasing number of recordings on DVD.

He joined with Giacomo Vincenti, with whom he published over 80 books between 1583 and 1586.  Many of these were reprints of popular madrigal books, but some were first printings.  Their partnership ended around 1586, but they continued to work together occasionally.  After 1586, Amadino's mark was a woodcut of an organ, and he printed primarily music, with a few theoretical treatises, including the first edition of Ercole Bottrigari's ""Il desiderio"".  He printed editions of such important composers as Luca Marenzio and Claudio Monteverdi, including the celebrated 1609 edition of ""L'Orfeo"", and in terms of sheer output was one of the foremost Italian music printers.

Title: Kamarinskaya
Body: Kamarinskaya (Russian: камаринская ) is a Russian traditional folk dance, which is mostly known today as the Russian composer Mikhail Glinka's composition of the same name.  Glinka's ""Kamarinskaya"", written in 1848, was the first orchestral work based entirely on Russian folk song and to use the compositional principles of that genre to dictate the form of the music.  It became a touchstone for the following generation of Russian composers ranging from the Western-oriented Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky to the group of nationalists known collectively as The Five and was also lauded abroad, most notably by French composer Hector Berlioz.

Body: Acis et Galatée (""Acis and Galatea"") is an opera by Jean-Baptiste Lully.  Unlike most of his operas, which are designated ""tragédies en musique"", Lully called this work a ""pastorale-héroïque"", because it was on a pastoral theme and had only three acts (plus a prologue) compared to the usual five.  Otherwise, there is little musically or dramatically to distinguish it from Lully's ""tragédies"".

Body: Pascal Collasse (or Colasse) (22 January 1649 (baptised) – 17 July 1709) was a French composer of the Baroque era.  Born in Rheims, Collasse became a disciple of Jean-Baptiste Lully during the latter's domination of the French operatic stage.  When Lully died in 1687 leaving his tragédie en musique ""Achille et Polyxène"" unfinished, Collasse completed the last four acts of the score.  He went on to produce around a dozen operas and ballets, as well as sacred music, including settings of the ""Cantiques spirituels"" of Jean Racine.  His plan to establish his own opera house in Lille ended in failure when the theatre burnt down.  He dabbled in alchemy with even less success.  His musical style is close to that of Lully.

Title: United States vice presidential selection, 1973
Body: In 1973, Republican Vice President Spiro Agnew was forced to resign following a controversy over his personal taxes.  Under the terms of the 25th Amendment, a vice presidential vacancy is filled when the president nominates a candidate who is confirmed by both houses of Congress.  Republican President Richard Nixon thus had the task of selecting a vice president who could receive the majority support of both houses of Congress.  Nixon considered selecting former Texas Governor John Connally, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, and California Governor Ronald Reagan.  However, Nixon settled on House Minority Leader Gerald Ford of Michigan, who was popular among the members of Congress and who was good friends with Nixon.  Ford won the approval of both houses by huge margins, and was sworn in as the 40th Vice President of the United States on December 6, 1973.  In 1974, Ford ascended to the presidency after the Watergate scandal led to the resignation of President Nixon.

Furthermore, this Act stated that material that was preserved could be used in judicial hearings and proceedings.  Immediately after this Act was enacted, Richard Nixon filed a lawsuit in a federal district court claiming that the Act violated the principle of separation of powers, the principle of presidential privilege, Nixon’s personal privacy, his First Amendment right of association, and further asserted that it amounted to a constitutionally prohibited Bill of Attainder.

Nixon considered selecting former Texas Governor John Connally, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, and California Governor Ronald Reagan.  However, Nixon settled on House Minority Leader Gerald Ford of Michigan, who was popular among the members of Congress and who was good friends with Nixon.  Ford won the approval of both houses by huge margins, and was sworn in as the 40th Vice President of the United States on December 6, 1973.  In 1974, Ford ascended to the presidency after the Watergate scandal led to the resignation of President Nixon.

Title: Open adoption
Body: Open adoption is a form of adoption in which the biological and adoptive families have access to varying degrees of each other's personal information and have an option of contact.  In Open Adoption, the adoptive parents hold all the rights as the legal parents, yet the individuals of the biological and adoptive families may exercise the option to open the contact in varying forms: from just sending mail and/or photos, to face-to-face visits between birth and adoptive families.

Title: Forced adoption in Australia
Body: Forced adoption was the practice of taking the babies from unmarried mothers, against their will, and placing them for adoption.  Former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard offered a national apology to those affected by forced adoptions in 2013.  The Australian Senate Inquiry Report into Forced Adoption Practices found that babies were taken illegally by doctors, nurses, social workers and religious figures, sometimes with the assistance of adoption agencies or other authorities, and adopted to married couples.  Some mothers were coerced, drugged and illegally had their consent taken.  Many of these adoptions occurred after the mothers were sent away by their families 'due to the stigma associated with being pregnant and unmarried'.  The removals occurred predominately in the second half of the twentieth century.  It was a practice which has been described as 'institutionalised baby farming'.

Source #3:
Title: Sixties Scoop
Body: The term Sixties Scoop refers to the practice of taking (""scooping up"") children of Aboriginal peoples in Canada from their families for placing in foster homes or adoption beginning in the 1960s and continuing to this day.  Provincially, each region had their specific adoption or fostering program and policy.  For example, Saskatchewan had the Adopt Indian Metis (AIM) Program.  The children were typically placed for adoption or fostering in Canada though a few were placed in the United States or western Europe.  The term ""Sixties scoop"" was coined by Patrick Johnston in his 1983 report ""Native Children and the Child Welfare System"".  It is a variation of the broader term Baby Scoop Era to refer to the period from the late 1950s to 1980s when large numbers of children were taken from their parents for adoption.  However and henceforth, the continued practice of taking Indigenous, Inuit and Metis children from their families for placing in foster homes or adoption is termed Millennium Scoop

The Act instead allowed the identity of the adopter to be concealed behind a serial number.  The act was repealed on 5 November 1993.

Title: Adoption (theology)
Body: Adoption, in Christian theology, is the admission of a believer into the family of God.  In the evangelical ""ordo salutis"" (""order of salvation""), adoption is usually regarded as a step immediately subsequent to justification.  As a theological word, adoption has similar connotations to the act of legally placing a child with a parent or parents other than those to whom they were born.  There are three references in the New Testament to God ""adopting"" Christians as his own children (Galatians 4:5, Romans 8:15 and Ephesians 1:5) and one reference to the adoption by God, of the ""people of Israel"" (Romans 9:4).  Adoption as a theological term introduces a relational dimension to the consequences of Salvation.  Adoption as a theological concept is also another consequence of the 'legal' act of justification, alongside redemption and reconciliation.  The Old Testament precedent for this term comes from the story of Mephibosheth, who despite not being part of Davidic family was included in the Royal inheritance (2 Samuel 9:7-13).  Adoption was an important feature of Reformation theology as demonstrated by article 12 of the Westminster Confession of Faith:

CCAI seeks to educate and inform Members of Congress in adoption, foster care, and child welfare issues that affect their constituents.  This is done through congressional briefings, leadership training programs, educational trips, and other notable programs.  The Institute's work is entirely funded by donations and gifts from organizations and individuals like the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.

Title: Trainmaster Command Control
Body: Trainmaster Command (TMCC) is Lionel's electronic control system for O scale 3-rail model trains and toy trains that mainly ran from 1994 to 2006.  Conceptually it is similar to Digital Command Control (DCC), the industry's open standard used by HO scale and other 2-rail DC trains.  It has one advantage over DCC, in that TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives and Lionel Legacy engines as well as LionChief and LionChief Plus equipped locomotives.  The latter require a dedicated remote controller.  MTH Corporation's DCS controller can be configured to control TMCC locomotives, and all four systems (TMCC, Legacy, LionChief/LionChief+ and DCS) can be operated on the same track simultaneously.  Each simply requires a constant track voltage (18 volts).  TMCC/Legacy ""broadcasts"" it's signal to the antenna on the locomotives which listen for signals that first identify the particular locomotive by number and then it issues given commands as to speed, direction, sounds, lighting and other features.  DCS performs similar functions but transmits a carrier over the rails which are picked up through the locomotive's electrical pickup contacts.  While TMCC/Legacy and DCS remote controls relay operator commands to a device that transmits them to the train (Command Base or Track Interface Unit), LionChief/LionChief+ also issue remote control commands but the remote and locomotive are married and each locomotive requires a separate remote control.  This system requires no additional wiring as the control is directly ""narrowcast"" to the locomotive in the same way as a television remote control or garage door opener functions.  In 2017, Lionel released a universal remote for LionChief+ that will learn addresses for up to three locos at a time, simplifying the operation of multiple trains.

Title: Vratsa waterfalls
Body: Two of the highest waterfalls in Bulgaria are located near the town of Vratsa, North-West Bulgaria.  One is named Skaklia and the other one Borov Kamak.  Skaklia (Bulgarian: Скакля ) is the name of two different waterfalls in Bulgaria.  The one near Vratsa is 130 metres high ( 141 metres according to other sources ) and is located 1.5 kilometres south of the town behind the Kaleto hill top .  It is considered one of the highest waterfalls in Bulgaria and on the Balkan peninsula.  Nevertheless, this remains a debatable question in Bulgaria until today, as this is a semi-active waterfall, not a constant one (not having constant flow of water) unlike the 124.5 metres high Raysko Praskalo (Heavenly Spray) also situated in Bulgaria.  Water falls from the vertical Skaklia cliff when there is heavy raining or after the massive melting of snow at the end of winter or early spring, otherwise little water can be seen from farther distances.  When active, however, the waterfall is easy to recognize from tourists standing many kilometres away from it, especially if they approach it from the north-west parts of Bulgaria.  In the waterfall area a lot of remains from the ancient Bulgarian village Patleina have been found.  Beautiful throughout the entire year it overlooks the town of Vratsa and the Vratsa lowlands.  The waterfall is a summit spot of different goat routes.  The Skaklia cliff itself is situated in a difficult to reach area and regardless of its clear visibility from the city, remains a difficult spot to reach by the majority of the tourists visiting Vratsa.

Washington in Ann Arbor, then moving to an office in Georgetown Mall on Packard St in Ann Arbor.  Interact Electronics Inc was a privately held company that was funded by Hongiman, Miller, Swartz and Cohn...a lawyer firm out of Detroit.  The President/Founder of Interact Electronics Inc was Ken Lochner, who was one of the original developers of the BASIC language based out of Dartmouth college.  Ken had started Interact Electronics Inc after a successful startup known as ADP Cyphernetics, the original computer time share company in Ann Arbor, now known as ADP Network Services.  Only a few thousand Interacts were sold before the company went bankrupt.  Most were sold by the liquidator ""Protecto Enterprizes"" of Barrington, Illinois through mail order sales.  The Interact Model One Home Computer debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1978 at a price of $499.  The majority of sales were thru Mail Order houses and you could buy it off the shelf at Highland Appliance in the Detroit, MI area and Newman Computer Exchange in Ann Arbor.  Probably the most successful application available for the Interace was a program called ""Message Center"".  With it, a store could type in whatever message they wanted to appear scrolling on a TV screen...like Advertisements, or welcoming messages to guests in an office.  Although it was mostly a Game machine at the time with games such as Showdown, BlackJack and Chess, there was also BASIC programming where users could create their own programs in the BASIC computer language.  Customers began hooking up Interact to control everything from lights in their house, to a Chevrolet Corvette!

Title: North American television frequencies
Body: North American television frequencies are different for over-the-air (also called terrestrial) and cable television systems.  Over-the-air television channels are divided into two bands: the VHF band which comprises channels 2 through 13 and occupies frequencies between 54 and 216 MHz, and the UHF band, which comprises channels 14 through 83 and occupies frequencies between 470 and 890 MHz.  These bands are different enough in frequency that they often require separate antennas to receive (although many antennas cover both VHF and UHF), and separate tuning controls on the television set.  The VHF band is further divided into two frequency ranges: VHF low band (Band I) between 54 and 88 MHz, containing channels 2 through 6, and VHF high band (Band III) between 174 and 216 MHz, containing channels 7 through 13.  The wide spacing between these frequency bands is responsible for the complicated design of rooftop TV antennas.  The UHF band has higher noise and greater attenuation, so higher gain antennas are often required for UHF.

It appears from the Latin original spelling of their name Gastoldus which is a variation of ""castaldius"" that they had been close to the Grand Dukes and that their function was to oversee ducal demesne.  Most power family gained during the reign of Casimir Jagiellon.  The castaldius of Vytautas, Andrius Goštautas might have been a voivode of Vilnius and Kreva, and father of Jonas, appears to have been the precursor of the family growth.

Passaro, a former U.S. Army Ranger, allegedly beat Wali for two consecutive nights, causing grievous injuries including a fractured pelvis.  Prosecutors would charge that Passaro ordered soldiers not to allow Wali to sleep, limited his access to food and water and subjected him to two consecutive nights of interrogation and beatings.  Among other injuries, Wali suffered a suspected fractured pelvis that would have made it impossible for him to urinate.  Witnesses testified that during one session Passaro, while wearing combat boots, kicked Wali in the groin hard enough to lift him off the ground, threw Wali to the ground, beat Wali on the arms and legs with a heavy Maglite flashlight, and that Passaro also vigorously thrust a flashlight into Wali's abdomen.  After the second night of beatings, Wali begged the soldiers to kill him and moaned a phrase that meant, ""I'm dying.""  Wali died on his fourth day in custody.  He repeatedly denied any involvement in the rocket attacks.

Title: Dictyosperma
Body: Dictyosperma is a monotypic genus of flowering plant in the palm family found in the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean (Mauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues).  The sole species, Dictyosperma album, is widely cultivated in the tropics but has been farmed to near extinction in its native habitat.  It is commonly called princess palm or hurricane palm, the latter owing to its ability to withstand strong winds by easily shedding leaves.  It is closely related to, and resembles, palms in the ""Archontophoenix"" genus.  The genus is named from two Greek words meaning ""net"" and ""seed"" and the epithet is Latin for ""white"", the common color of the crownshaft at the top of the trunk.

Source #2:
Title: Huernia
Body: The genus Huernia (family Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae) consists of stem succulents from Eastern and Southern Africa, first described as a genus in 1810.  The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus ""Stapelia"", and often striped vividly in contrasting colours or tones, some glossy, others matt and wrinkled depending on the species concerned.  To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion.  The genus is considered close to the genera ""Stapelia"" and ""Hoodia"".  The name is in honour of Justin Heurnius (1587–1652) a Dutch missionary who is reputed to have been the first collector of South African Cape plants.  His name was actually mis-spelt by the collector.

Title: Crank Caverns
Body: Crank Caverns is the common name of the remains of the Rainford Delph Quarry near Crank in St. Helens, Merseyside.  It is a network of underground tunnels and caverns, as well as an extensive woodland.  Information in the St. Helens local history archives states that sandstone quarrying began here as early as 1730.  As the quarry expanded, the cost of purchasing land to open cast mine it increased, so it was decided to opt for a different method.  Instead of quarrying out the stone, they would mine it out, following a seam of stone until it ran out.  This resulted in the network of caves, tunnels and shafts we see today.  Rainford Delph is listed as a Colliery by 1854, under the ownership of Charles Howarth or Yorkshire Charlie as he was known locally by 1880.  Mining finally ceased and the woods and caverns were used as a game reserve by the Earl of Derby until 1939, when they became a storage facility for ammunition for the anti-aircraft position at Crank.  After the war, the caverns ceased use as a game reserve.  Today, Crank Caverns are not officially open to the public and due to their increasing instability, attempts have been made to close access to the caverns and tunnels themselves.  Despite this, the site is still physically accessible from a nearby public footpath and is still a draw for generations of curious locals who wish to explore, many having heard the numerous local myths and legends from an early age.

The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.  In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites.  Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies.  The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919.  The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920.  Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923.  The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.  There were an estimated 7,000,000–12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians.

Title: List of Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine
Body: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Swedish: ""Nobelpriset i fysiologi eller medicin"" ) is awarded annually by the Swedish Karolinska Institute to scientists and doctors in the various fields of physiology or medicine.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.  As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members and an executive secretary elected by the Karolinska Institute.  While commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Medicine, Nobel specifically stated that the prize be awarded for ""physiology or medicine"" in his will.  Because of this, the prize can be awarded in a broader range of fields.  The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to Emil Adolf von Behring, of Germany.  Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years.  In 1901, von Behring received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2008.  In 2013, the prize was awarded to James E. Rothman, Randy W. Schekman and Thomas C. Südhof; they were recognised ""after discovering how cells precisely transport material"".  The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.

Title: Cosmic catastrophe
Body: The Cosmic catastrophe is a thought experiment in which the sun were to instantaneously disappear.  The question is what would then happen to the earth and the other planets orbiting the sun.  According to Isaac Newton's classical theory of gravity, the planets would immediately cease to move in circular motion, and due to inertia would start traveling in a straight line.  Albert Einstein saw a deficiency in Newton's theory.  Due to the finiteness of the speed of light, it would take a certain amount of time before the darkness from the sun's absence would reach the orbiting planet.  Therefore, why would the planet instantaneously start traveling in a straight line before the arrival of information that the sun's disappearance has occurred?

Title: Nobel Prize in Literature
Body: Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature (Swedish: ""Nobelpriset i litteratur"" ) has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced ""in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction"" (original Swedish: ""den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning"").  Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here ""work"" refers to an author's work as a whole.  The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year.  The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Title: Kapitza number
Body: The Kapitza number (Ka) is a dimensionless number named after the prominent Russian physicist Pyotr Kapitsa (Peter Kapitza).  He provided the first extensive study of the ways in which a thin film of liquid flows down inclined surfaces.  Expressed as the ratio of surface tension forces to inertial forces, the Kapitza number acts as an indicator of the hydrodynamic wave regime in falling liquid films.  Liquid film behavior represents a subset of the more general class of free boundary problems. and is important in a wide range of engineering and technological applications such as evaporators, heat exchangers, absorbers, microreactors, small-scale electronics/microprocessor cooling schemes, air conditioning and gas turbine blade cooling.

Title: Power factor
Body: In electrical engineering, the power factor of an AC electrical power system is defined as the ratio of the real power flowing to the load to the apparent power in the circuit, and is a dimensionless number in the closed interval of −1 to 1.  A power factor of less than one means that the voltage and current waveforms are not in phase, reducing the instantaneous product of the two waveforms (V × I).  Real power is the capacity of the circuit for performing work in a particular time.  Apparent power is the product of the current and voltage of the circuit.  Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source, or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source, the apparent power will be greater than the real power.  A negative power factor occurs when the device (which is normally the load) generates power, which then flows back towards the source, which is normally considered the generator.

Title: Weissenberg number
Body: The Weissenberg number (Wi) is a dimensionless number used in the study of viscoelastic flows.  It is named after Karl Weissenberg.  The dimensionless number compares the viscous forces to the elastic forces.  It can be variously defined, but it is usually given by the relation of stress relaxation time of the fluid and a specific process time.  For instance, in simple steady shear, the Weissenberg number, often abbreviated as Wi or We, is defined as the shear rate formula_1 times the relaxation time formula_2.  Using the Maxwell Model and the Oldroyd Model, the elastic forces can be written as the first Normal force (N).

Title: F-number
Body: The f-number of an optical system such as a camera lens is the ratio of the system's focal length to the diameter of the entrance pupil.  It is a dimensionless number that is a quantitative measure of lens speed, and an important concept in photography.  It is also known as the focal ratio, f-ratio, or f-stop.  It is the reciprocal of the relative aperture.  The f-number is commonly indicated using a hooked f with the format f/ N, where N is the f-number.

Source #9:
Title: Fourier number
Body: In physics and engineering, the Fourier number (Fo) or Fourier modulus, named after Joseph Fourier, is a dimensionless number that characterizes transient heat conduction.  Conceptually, it is the ratio of diffusive or conductive transport rate to the quantity storage rate, where the quantity may be either heat (thermal energy) or matter (particles).  The number derives from non-dimensionalization of the heat equation (also known as Fourier's Law) or Fick's second law and is used along with the Biot number to analyze time dependent transport phenomena.

Source #10:
Title: Womersley number
Body: The Womersley number (α) is a dimensionless number in biofluid mechanics.  It is a dimensionless expression of the pulsatile flow frequency in relation to viscous effects.  It is named after John R. Womersley (1907–1958) for his work with blood flow in arteries.  The Womersley number is important in keeping dynamic similarity when scaling an experiment.  An example of this is scaling up the vascular system for experimental study.  The Womersley number is also important in determining the thickness of the boundary layer to see if entrance effects can be ignored.

Title: Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics
Body: The mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are those mathematical formalisms that permit a rigorous description of quantum mechanics.  Such are distinguished from mathematical formalisms for theories developed prior to the early 1900s by the use of abstract mathematical structures, such as infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and operators on these spaces.  Many of these structures are drawn from functional analysis, a research area within pure mathematics that was influenced in part by the needs of quantum mechanics.  In brief, values of physical observables such as energy and momentum were no longer considered as values of functions on phase space, but as eigenvalues; more precisely as spectral values of linear operators in Hilbert space.

Title: Relativistic quantum mechanics
Body: In physics, relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) is any Poincaré covariant formulation of quantum mechanics (QM).  This theory is applicable to massive particles propagating at all velocities up to those comparable to the speed of light ""c"", and can accommodate massless particles.  The theory has application in high energy physics, particle physics and accelerator physics, as well as atomic physics, chemistry and condensed matter physics.  ""Non-relativistic quantum mechanics"" refers to the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics applied in the context of Galilean relativity, more specifically quantizing the equations of classical mechanics by replacing dynamical variables by operators. ""Relativistic quantum mechanics"" (RQM) is quantum mechanics applied with special relativity, but not general relativity.  Although the earlier formulations, like the Schrödinger picture and Heisenberg picture were originally formulated in a non-relativistic background, these pictures of quantum mechanics also apply with special relativity.

This interpretation of quantum mechanics is based on a consistency criterion that then allows probabilities to be assigned to various alternative histories of a system such that the probabilities for each history obey the rules of classical probability while being consistent with the Schrödinger equation.  In contrast to some interpretations of quantum mechanics, particularly the Copenhagen interpretation, the framework does not include ""wavefunction collapse"" as a relevant description of any physical process, and emphasizes that measurement theory is not a fundamental ingredient of quantum mechanics.

Title: Quantum chaos
Body: Quantum chaos is a branch of physics which studies how chaotic classical dynamical systems can be described in terms of quantum theory.  The primary question that quantum chaos seeks to answer is: ""What is the relationship between quantum mechanics and classical chaos?""  The correspondence principle states that classical mechanics is the classical limit of quantum mechanics.  If this is true, then there must be quantum mechanisms underlying classical chaos (although this may not be a fruitful way of examining classical chaos).  If quantum mechanics does not demonstrate an exponential sensitivity to initial conditions, how can exponential sensitivity to initial conditions arise in classical chaos, which must be the correspondence principle limit of quantum mechanics?  In seeking to address the basic question of quantum chaos, several approaches have been employed:

Title: Grete Hermann
Body: Grete (Henry-)Hermann (March 2, 1901 – April 15, 1984) was a German mathematician and philosopher noted for her work in mathematics, physics, philosophy and education.  She is noted for her early philosophical work on the foundations of quantum mechanics, and is now known most of all for an early, but long-ignored refutation of a ""no-hidden-variable theorem"" by John von Neumann.  The disputed theorem and the fact that Hermann's critique of this theorem remained nearly unknown for decades are considered to have had a strong influence on the development of quantum mechanics.

Clark would retire and be replaced by Maj. Gen George G. Finch on the UN command delegation to the Korean armistice talks George G. Finch, born April 11, 1902 in Dade City, Florida, is considered one of the pioneers in United States aviation history.  He began his military career during World War 1, enlisting in the Aviation Section of the Army's Signal Corps in 1918.  He remained in the Reserve Corps after the war, and in 1926, became Commander, 27th Pursuit Squadron, 1st Pursuit Group.  In 1940, Georgia Governor Ed Rivers commissioned him to form the first flying unit of the Georgia Air National Guard.  The unit was mobilized into the U.S. Army in September, 1941, with Major Finch as commander.  After World War II, he was a leading critic of efforts to eliminate the air arm of the National Guard during peacetime.  General Finch gained the respect and admiration of Air National Guardsmen throughout the nation with his steadfast support and successful efforts to preserve the Air Guard.  He became the first Chief of the Air Force Division of the National Guard Bureau in 1948.  Under his leadership, the Air National Guard built to combat readiness and was among the first components called into service after the outbreak of the Korean War.  As a result of General Finch's vision and perseverance, 45,000 highly trained officers and airmen of 22 wings and 65 squadrons gave the Air Force the strength it needed in the early, critical phases of the Communist drive down the Korean peninsula.General Finch served as the senior Air Force member of the United Nations negotiating team at the peace talks at Panmunjom, Korea, and received the Legion of Merit for outstanding service in 1955; General Finch assumed command of Fourteenth Air Force, Robins AFB, Georgia, becoming the nation's first Air National Guardsman to head a numbered air force.  General Finch had a career of ""firsts"" including the US Army's first night landing with a single, five-million-candlepower floodlight in 1927.  He also established and endowed the General John P. McConnell Award at the United States Air Force Academy.  Considered by many as the father of the strong, independent Air National Guard existing today, General Finch retired in 1957.  No man has had greater impact on the Air Force Reserve and National Guard than has General George G. Finch.A graduate of the University of Georgia and a member of the Georgia Bar, General Finch was enshrined in the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame May 18, 1996.

Title: Battle of Bataan
Body: The Battle of Bataan (7 January – 9 April 1942) represented the most intense phase of Imperial Japan's invasion of the Philippines during World War II.  In January 1942, forces of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy invaded Luzon along with several islands in the Philippine Archipelago after the bombing of the American naval base at Pearl Harbor.  The commander-in-chief of all Filipino and American forces in the islands, General Douglas MacArthur, consolidated all of his Luzon-based units on the Bataan Peninsula to fight against the Japanese invaders.  By this time, the Japanese controlled nearly all of Southeast Asia.  The Bataan peninsula and the island of Corregidor were the only remaining Allied strongholds in the region.  Despite a lack of supplies, Filipino and American forces managed to fight the Japanese for three months, engaging them initially in a fighting retreat southward.  As the combined Filipino and American forces made a last stand, the delay cost the Japanese valuable time and prevented immediate victory across the Pacific.  The surrender at Bataan, with 76,000 soldiers surrendering in the Philippines altogether, was the largest in American and Filipino military histories, and was the largest United States surrender since the American Civil War's Battle of Harper's Ferry.  Soon afterwards, Filipino and American prisoners of war were forced into the Bataan Death March.

Title: Teddy Roosevelt Terrier
Body: The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier.  Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.  Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.  Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.

These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners.  Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier.

Title: Viol
Body: The viol , viola da gamba ] , or (informally) gamba, is any one of a family of bowed, fretted and stringed instruments with hollow wooden bodies and pegboxes where the tension on the strings can be increased or decreased to adjust the pitch of each of the strings.  Frets on the viol are usually made of gut, tied on the fingerboard around the instrument's neck, to enable the performer to stop the strings more cleanly.  Frets improve consistency of intonation and lend the stopped notes a tone which better matches the open strings.  Viols first appeared in Spain in the mid to late 15th century and were most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque (1600-1750) periods.  Early ancestors include the Arabic ""rebab"" and the medieval European vielle, but later, more direct possible ancestors include the Venetian ""viole"" and the 15th- and 16th-century Spanish ""vihuela"", a 6-course plucked instrument tuned like a lute (and also like a present-day viol) that looked like but was quite distinct from (at that time) the 4-course guitar (an earlier chordophone).

Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct.  Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types.  Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability.  While the AKC has a breed they call ""Collie"", in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds.  There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports.  They typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity.

Title: Subfunctionalization
Body: Subfunctionalization was proposed by Stoltzfus (1999) and Force et al. (1999) as one of the possible outcomes of functional divergence that occurs after a gene duplication event, in which pairs of genes that originate from duplication, or paralogs, take on separate functions.  Subfunctionalization is a neutral mutation process; meaning that no new adaptations are formed.  During the process of gene duplication paralogs simply undergo a division of labor by retaining different parts (subfunctions) of their original ancestral function.  This partitioning event occurs because of segmental gene silencing leading to the formation of paralogs that are no longer duplicates, because each gene only retains a single function.  It is important to note that the ancestral gene was capable of performing both functions and the descendant duplicate genes can now only perform one of the original ancestral functions.

Title: American Eskimo Dog
Body: The American Eskimo Dog is a breed of companion dog originating in Germany.  The American Eskimo is a member of the Spitz family.  The breed's progenitors were German Spitz, but due to anti-German prejudice during the First World War, it was renamed ""American Eskimo Dog"".  Although modern American Eskimos have been exported as German Spitz Gross (or Mittel, depending on the dog's height), the breeds have diverged and the standards are significantly different.  In addition to serving as a watchdog and companion, the American Eskimo Dog also achieved a high degree of popularity in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s as a circus performer.

Title: English Springer Spaniel
Body: The English Springer Spaniel is a breed of gun dog in the Spaniel family traditionally used for flushing and retrieving game.  It is an affectionate, excitable breed with a typical lifespan of twelve to fourteen years.  They are very similar to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and are descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century; the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines.  The breed suffers from average health complaints.  The show-bred version of the breed has been linked to ""rage syndrome"", although the disorder is very rare.  It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely to the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter.  The smaller ""cockers"" hunted woodcock while the larger littermates were used to flush, or ""spring,"" game.  In 1902, The Kennel Club recognized the English Springer Spaniel as a distinct breed.  They are used as sniffer dogs on a widespread basis.  The term ""Springer"" comes from the historic hunting role, where the dog would flush (spring) birds into the air.

Title: Picardy Spaniel
Body: The Picardy Spaniel is a breed of dog developed in France for use as a gundog.  It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds.  It is thought to be one of the two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain.  However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century.  Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears, it can be prone to ear infections.

Source #5:
Title: Welsh Springer Spaniel
Body: The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a breed of dog and a member of the spaniel family.  Thought to be comparable to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel.  They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity.  Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel.  The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern.  Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers.  Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions.  They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.

Source #6:
Title: American Cocker Spaniel
Body: The American Cocker Spaniel is a breed of sporting dog.  It is a spaniel type dog that is closely related to the English Cocker Spaniel; the two breeds diverged during the 20th century due to differing breed standards in America and the UK.  In the United States, the breed is usually called the Cocker Spaniel, while elsewhere in the world, it is called the American Cocker Spaniel in order to differentiate between it and its English cousin, which was already known as ""Cocker Spaniel"" before the American variety was created.  The word ""cocker"" is commonly held to stem from their use to hunt woodcock in England, while ""spaniel"" is thought to be derived from the type's origins in Spain.

Title: Norfolk Spaniel
Body: The Norfolk Spaniel or Shropshire Spaniel is an extinct breed of dog since the early 20th century.

The term was used to designate springer type spaniels that were neither Sussex nor Clumber Spaniels, and attempts were made to use it to specify a breed that would later become known as the English Springer Spaniel.

Lots of Transylvanian farmers changed their ordinary sheep to Tsigai, because people bought its wool much more.  Although it was a mountain sheep it adapted to lowlands really fast.  Most of the Tsigais were kept between the Danube and the Tisza, and this is where they remained breed them after the I. World War too.

Title: First Italo-Ethiopian War
Body: The First Italo-Ethiopian War was fought between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896.  It originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate.  Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria.  Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected.  In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war.  Ethiopia was also supported diplomatically by the United Kingdom and France in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor.  Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender.  Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea.

Title: Ethiopia–Japan relations
Body: Ethiopia–Japan relations are the international relations between Ethiopia and Japan.  Both were nations with an ancient history which successfully repulsed European military advances to dominate them, Ethiopia at the Battle of Adwa, and Japan at the Battle of Tsushima, and as a result both nations considered each other potential allies prior to World War II.

Title: Outline of Ethiopia
Body: Ethiopia is a landlocked sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa.  Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south-west, Kenya to the south, Somalia to the east and Djibouti to the north-east.  Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and Africa's second-most populous nation.  Ethiopia has yielded some of humanity's oldest traces, making the area important in the history of human evolution.  Recent studies claim that the vicinity of present-day Addis Ababa was the point from which human beings migrated around the world.  Ethiopian dynastic history traditionally began with the reign of Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC.  The roots of the Ethiopian state are similarly deep, dating with unbroken continuity to at least the Aksumite Empire (which adopted the name ""Ethiopia"" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots).  After a period of decentralized power in the 18th and early 19th centuries known as the Zemene Mesafint (""Era of the Judges/Princes""), the country was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history.  Ethiopia's borders underwent significant territorial expansion to its modern borders for the rest of the century, especially by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena, culminating in its victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 with the military leadership of Ras Makonnen, and ensuring its sovereignty and freedom from colonization.  It was brutally occupied by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy from 1936 to 1941, ending with its liberation by British Empire and Ethiopian Patriot forces.

Title: Herbert S. Lewis
Body: Herbert S. Lewis (born May 8, 1934) is Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he taught from 1963 to 1998.  He has conducted extensive field research.  In Ethiopia, Lewis studied both the history of the Oromo (Galla) Kingdom of Jimma Abba Jifar and the lives of contemporary Oromos from 1958–60 and in 1965–66.  (Many of his ethnographic photographs are visible in the University of Wisconsin's Digital Library.  See the link to Africa Focus below).  His work in Ethiopia was concerned above all with political leadership and community organization as well as ethnohistory and culture history.  The book, originally titled A Galla Monarchy: Jimma Abba Jifar, Ethiopia, 1830-1932, is a study of the nature of the monarchy, the sources of the ruler's power, as well as its origins.  The study in 1965-66 centered on community life and the leadership of spirit mediums, k'allu, who effectively organized religious life and conflict resolution, and provided a degree of political leadership for rural districts.

Title: P'ent'ay
Body: P'ent'ay (from Amharic: , also transliterated as Pentay or Pente) is an Amharic and Tigrinya language term for a Christian of a Protestant denomination, widely used in Ethiopia and among Ethiopians and Eritreans living abroad.  The term was coined in the late 1960s and was used as a pejorative for churches that believed in the Pentecostal experience.  Today, it is used to describe local Protestant Christians who are not members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo churches.  The term ""P'ent'ay"" is a shortening of the word ""Pentecostal""; however, it is widely used when referring to all Protestant Christians whether they are actual Pentecostals or not.  Some Orthodox will also apply the term to the small Catholic population of Ethiopia.  The equivalent rendition in many other languages is Evangelicals.  The four major Evangelical denominations in Ethiopia are: the Kale Heywet (Word of Life); Mekane Yesus (Place of Jesus), Lutheran; Mulu Wongel (Full Gospel) and Meserete Kristos (meaning ""Christ foundation"") or Mennonite.  Some P'ent'ay communities - especially Mekane Yesus - have been influenced by the Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which represents mainstream, traditional Ethiopian Christianity.  But for the most part they are very Pentecostal in their worship and theology.

Title: Treaty of Addis Ababa
Body: The Treaty of Addis Ababa, signed 23 October 1896, formally ended the First Italo–Ethiopian War on terms mostly favorable to Ethiopia.  This treaty superseded a secret agreement between Ethiopia and Italy negotiated days after the decisive Battle of Adwa in March of the same year, in which Ethiopian forces commanded by Menelik II defeated the Italians.  The most important concession the Italians made was the abrogation of the Treaty of Wuchale and recognizing Ethiopia as an independent country.

Title: Foreign relations of Ethiopia
Body: Many historians trace modern Ethiopia's foreign policy to the reign of Emperor Tewodros II, whose primary concerns were the security of Ethiopia's traditional borders, obtaining technology from Europe (or modernization), and to a lesser degree Ethiopian rights to the monastery of Dar-es-Sultan in the city of Jerusalem.  Tewodros' diplomatic efforts, however, ended disastrously with the British expedition of 1868 which concluded with his death.  Despite the efforts of his successor Emperor Yohannes IV to establish a relationship with the United Kingdom, Ethiopia was ignored by the world powers until the opening of the Suez Canal, and more important, the Mahdist War, drew outside attention to her once more.

Title: Mengistu Haile Mariam
Body: Mengistu Haile Mariam (Amharic: , pronounced ] ; born 21 May 1937) is an Ethiopian politician who was the leader of Ethiopia from 1977 to 1991.  He was the chairman of the Derg, the Communist military junta that governed Ethiopia, from 1977 to 1987, and the President of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia from 1987 to 1991.  The Derg took power in the Ethiopian Revolution following the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie I in 1974, marking the end of the Solomonic dynasty which had ruled Ethiopia since the 13th century.  Mengistu purged rivals for power from the Derg and made himself Ethiopia's dictator, attempting to modernise Ethiopia's feudal economy through Marxist-inspired policies such as nationalisation and land redistribution.  His bloody consolidation of power in 1977-1978 is known as the Ethiopian Red Terror, a brutal crackdown on opposition groups and civilians following a failed assassination attempt by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party in September 1976, after they had ignored the Derg's invitation to join the union of socialist parties.

Title: Italians of Ethiopia
Body: Italians of Ethiopia are the emigrants and colonists from Italy who moved to live in Ethiopia as far back as the 19th century, and their descendants.  King Menelik II did not allow the sale of lands belonging to Ethiopia to Italians (Eritrea) and probably allowed France (Djibouti) to solidify his centralized power and have external trading partners.  There was a subsequent exchange of ideas, farming techniques, education and technology between the Italians and Ethiopians during most of this period, including transportation—most notably the Italian engineers who helped to architect an build the aqueducts and rail system for Ethiopia's railway system from the new capital, Addis Ababa to then French controlled Djibouti port.  However, the relationship was often marked by the fact that under various treaties written in both Amharic and Italian, the Italian version always referred to Ethiopia as a protectorate of Italy.  Most of the Italians moved to Ethiopia after the Italian conquest of Abyssinia in 1936.

Title: Survivor Africa: Panama
Body: Survivor Africa: Panama was the first pan-regional season of the television show ""Survivor"" to air in central or southern Africa and it included contestants from the countries of Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.  The show was broadcast on the channel M-net from September 3, 2006, to November 19, 2006, during which time twelve episodes aired.  The contestants for this season were initially split into two tribes, the Embera tribe, named after Panama's semi-nomadic and heavily body-painted tribe, whose buffs were blue, and the Kuna tribe, named after a traditionally matriarchal and politically organised people of Panama, whose buffs were red.  During the pre-merge portion of the program the Embera tribe dominated as they won the majority of both the reward and immunity challenges while Kuna saw their numbers dwindle from six to three.  When the tribes merged into the Nagual tribe their buff colors may have changed to yellow, but their original tribal alliances remained and the former members of Embera quickly voted out Yagazie ""Yaga"" Chuwumerje and Nana Sarpong, leaving Metasebia ""Meti"" Yilma as the only former Kuna member left in the game.  Following the elimination of Nana, Tsholofelo ""Tebby"" Gasenelwe approached Meti and Olanike ""Nike"" Gbolahan about forming an all-girl alliance.  Once formed, the girl alliance, along with Jeremiah Zulu, voted out both Leonard Mapuranga and the leader of the former Embera alliance, Derrick Assetto.  When it came time for the final four, the contestants competed in two challenges in order to determine the final two.  The first of these challenges was the ""plank"" challenge.  As Meti was the first person to fall off the plank, she was eliminated from the game.  As Tebby was the last person to fall off the plank, she automatically advanced to the final two.  The other two contestants competed in a second challenge which Jeremiah won and advanced to the final two while Nike was eliminated.  Ultimately, it was Gasenelwe from Botswana who won this season over Jeremiah Zulu with a jury vote of 6–0.

On 19 April 1319, his father granted him the title of Despot of Romania, which actually corresponded to rule over a small part of Albania, but also to the Prince of Taranto's claim on the Despotate of Epirus to the south.  In May 1321, Philip was engaged to Beatrice, daughter of Count Louis I of Clermont.  She brought as her dowry the 40,000 ""livres tournois"", which Louis had agreed to pay Duke Odo IV of Burgundy in exchange for Odo's claim to the Principality of Achaea.  Instead, Prince Philip had arranged to purchase Odo's rights for the same amount and marry his son to Louis's daughter.  The engagement with Beatrice was canceled by 1329, when Philip married Violante (Yolanda), daughter of King James II of Aragon.  In 1328, Philip's father decided to send a fleet to conquer the Despotate of Epirus.  The fleet finally embarked in 1329.  The younger Philip got as far as Nafpaktos, but on the eve of launching the land expedition, he died.  Philip predeceased his father.  Violante, his widow, died in 1353.

He was the son of Thomas, Count of Savoy, and owed his initial ecclesiastical posts to his father.  Other members of his family were also clergymen, and a brother succeeded his father as count.  One niece was married to King Henry III of England and another was married to King Louis IX of France.  It was Henry who secured Boniface's election as Archbishop, and throughout his tenure of that office he spent much time on the continent.  He clashed with his bishops, with his nephew-by-marriage, and with the papacy, but managed to eliminate the archiepiscopal debt which he had inherited on taking office.  During Simon de Montfort's struggle with King Henry, Boniface initially helped Montfort's cause, but later supported the king.

It was practically a union between Italy and Albania, officially led by Italy's King Victor Emmanuel III and its government: Albania was led by Italian governors, after being militarily occupied by Italy, from 1939 until 1943.  During this time, Albania ceased to exist as an independent country and remained as an autonomous part of the Italian Empire led by Italian government officials, who intended to make Albania part of a Greater Italy by assimilating Albanians as Italians and colonizing Albania with Italian settlers from the Italian Peninsula to transform it gradually into an Italian land.

Title: Findochty
Body: Findochty (pronounced ), Scots: ""Finichty"" , Scottish Gaelic: ""Am Fionn Ochdamh"" ) is a village in Moray, Scotland on the shores of the Moray Firth; historically it was part of Banffshire.  The Gaelic name of the village was recorded by Diack using his own transcription method as ""fanna-guchti"", which is of unclear meaning.  One of the earliest references to Findochty is in 1440, when the King granted Findachtifeild to John Dufe, son of John Dufe.  The lands passed from the Duffs to the Ogilvies of Findlater and subsequently, in 1568, the Ord family acquired the manor, port, custom and fishers' lands of Findochty, and later built the House of Findochty, known as Findochty Castle, now a ruin, which stands to the west of the village.  In 1716 the Ords brought 13 men and 4 boys from Fraserburgh under contract to fish from Findochty, and for a time the harbour was busy with landings of herring and white fish.  Findochty expanded as a fishing port through the 1700s and 1800s, and by 1850 was home to 140 fishing boats.  But the expansion in the late 1800s of nearby Buckie provided a better harbour, and some of the fishing fleet had left Findochty by 1890.  Findochty harbour is now used mostly by pleasure craft and is a good sun spot when the tide is out.  A local artist, Correna Cowie created a statue in 1959 of a seated fisherman, known as The Mannie, who watches over the harbour.

The vaulted south aisle, with bell-tower, and a detached chapter house (used as the tollbooth of Fortrose after the Reformation) remain.  These fragments, though modest in scale, display considerable architectural refinement, and are in the care of Historic Scotland (no entrance charge).  The burgh is a popular location for trying to spot bottlenose dolphins (see Chanonry Point) in the Moray Firth.

Title: Trash Box
Body: Trash Box is a 5-CD box set of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings, primarily by American bands.  This box set is similar to the earlier ""Pebbles Box"" (a 5-LP box set) and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set (and in the same order), along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc.  Supposedly, ""the Trash Box"" collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records).  However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on ""Pebbles, Volume 4"" have been eschewed entirely.  Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the ""Pebbles Box"".  Although most of the recordings on ""the Trash Box"" were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series.  Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit ""I Fought the Law (but the Law Won)"" by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) – which is also included in the ""Pebbles Box"" – in place of the much rarer ""Wine Wine Wine"" by Bobby Fuller that appears on ""Pebbles, Volume 2"".

Title: Mono Masters
Body: Mono Masters is a compilation album by the Beatles, and is an alternate, all-mono version of the album ""Past Masters"".  ""Mono Masters"" was originally a two-CD set included as part of ""The Beatles in Mono"" box set.  The premise of this box set was to compile only Beatles material which was released or prepared for release with a dedicated mono mix (the set excludes later material mixed and released only in stereo, and material whose mono version was simply created as an equal mix of the two channels of the stereo version).  As a result, the track listing for ""Mono Masters"" differs from ""Past Masters"" on the second half of disc two, omitting some later songs that never had a mono mix (""Old Brown Shoe"", ""The Ballad of John and Yoko"" and ""Let It Be""), and adding several songs released on stereo-only albums that had unreleased mono mixes.  Tracks 9–12 and 15 were prepared in March 1969 for release as a 7"" mono ""Yellow Submarine"" EP, two months after the release of the similarly titled soundtrack album, but the project was scrapped, although the EP was mastered.  Subsequently, the tracks were only released in stereo (and in an electronically produced mono mixdown, or ""fold-down"", of the stereo mix), while the true mono mixes remained unreleased.  ""Get Back"" (with B-side ""Don't Let Me Down"") was the final Beatles single mixed for mono format.  It was released in the UK in mono, though the US release was in stereo.  Thus, the songs that were originally released on stereo singles in the UK are omitted on this release.

Spruces are large trees, from about 20–60 m (about 60–200 ft) tall when mature, and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form.  The needles, or leaves, of spruce trees are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion, each needle on a small, peg-like structure.  The needles are shed when 4–10 years old, leaving the branches rough with the retained pegs (an easy means of distinguishing them from other similar genera, where the branches are fairly smooth).

Title: Rhizanthes
Body: Rhizanthes is a genus of 4 species of parasitic flowering plants without leaves, stems, roots, or photosynthetic tissue.  They grow on roots of a few species of ""Tetrastigma"" vines.  The genus is limited to the tropical forests of south and south-east Asia.  The flowers of ""Rhizanthes"" vary from 14 to 43 cm in diameter.  At least one species of ""Rhizanthes"", ""R. lowii"", is endothermic.  It not only produces its own heat, but has the rare ability to regulate its own temperature.

Title: Trellis (architecture)
Body: A trellis (treillage) is an architectural structure, usually made from an open framework or lattice of interwoven or intersecting pieces of wood, bamboo or metal that is normally made to support and display climbing plants, especially shrubs.  There are many types of trellis for different places and for different plants, from agricultural types, especially in viticulture, which are covered at vine training systems, to garden uses for climbers such as grapevines, clematis, ivy, and climbing roses or other support based growing plants.  The rose trellis is especially common in Europe and other rose-growing areas, and many climbing rose varieties require a trellis to reach their potential as garden plants.  Some plants will climb and wrap themselves round a trellis without much artificial help being needed while others need training by passing the growing shoots through the trellis and/or tying them to the framework.

Title: Rafflesiaceae
Body: The Rafflesiaceae are a family of rare parasitic plants found in the tropical forests of east and southeast Asia, including ""Rafflesia arnoldii"", which has the largest flowers of all plants.  The plants are endoparasites of vines in the genus ""Tetrastigma"" (Vitaceae) and lack stems, leaves, roots, and any photosynthetic tissue.  They rely entirely on their host plants for both water and nutrients, and only then emerge as flowers from the roots or lower stems of the host plants.

Title: Elliott Knob
Body: Elliott Knob is one of the highest mountains in the northern portions of the U.S. state of Virginia.  At 4463 ft , the peak is located on the ridge known as Great North Mountain.  A subpeak known simply as ""Hogback"" (4447 ft ) is located .50 mi to the southwest.  A small, naturally growing stand of red spruce trees are on the summit, and the upper slopes also have yellow birch and sugar maple, indicating that the altitude is just high enough to support tree species normally found hundreds of miles to the north.  Otherwise oak and hickory trees are the most common types found on the mountain.  The mountain is entirely within George Washington and Jefferson National Forests.

Title: Typhonodorum
Body: Typhonodorum is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.  The single species making up this genus is Typhonodorum lindleyanum.  The genus is native to Madagascar, the Comores, Zanzibar, and Mauritius.  This genus is believed to be closely related to ""Peltandra"" even though ""Peltandra"" is only found in North America and there don't appear to exist closely related genera in the African mainland.  There isn't fossil evidence to link the two genera so it has been proposed that there once was a genus in Africa from which the two genera had originated.  The African mainland genus spread to North America and to Madagascar 50 million years ago before it broke off.  Then the African genus became extinct and the North American and Madagascan genera remained.

Title: Casuarinaceae
Body: The Casuarinaceae are a family of dicotyledonous flowering plants placed in the order Fagales, consisting of four genera and 91 species of trees and shrubs native to the Australia, Southeast Asia, Malesia, Papuasia, and the Pacific Islands.  At one time, all species were placed in the genus ""Casuarina"".  Lawrie A. S. Johnson separated out many of those species and renamed them into the new genera of ""Gymnostoma"" in 1980 and 1982, ""Allocasuarina"" in 1982, and ""Ceuthostoma"" in 1988, with some additional formal descriptions of new species in each other genus.  At the time, it was somewhat controversial.  The monophyly of these genera was later supported in a 2003 genetics study of the family.  In the Wettstein system, this family was the only one placed in the order Verticillatae.  Likewise, in the Engler, Cronquist, and Kubitzki systems, the Casuarinaceae were the only family placed in the order Casuarinales.

Title: Claiming race
Body: A claiming race in thoroughbred horse racing is one in which the horses are all for sale for more or less the same price (the ""claiming price"") up until shortly before the race.  Race types form a hierarchy in terms of the quality of horse they attract, with handicap races and graded stakes races attracting the ""best"" horses and maiden races the most unseasoned.  Claiming races fall at the bottom of this hierarchy, below maiden races, and make up the bulk of races run at most US tracks.  For example in Kentucky in 1999, 54% of all races run were claiming races, but had only 20% of the purse dollar value, the lowest average purse among race types.

Title: Tidal flooding
Body: Tidal flooding, also known as sunny day flooding or nuisance flooding, is the temporary inundation of low-lying areas, especially streets, during exceptionally high tide events, such as at full and new moons.  The highest tides of the year may be known as the king tide, with the month varying by location.  In Florida, controversy was created when state-level government mandated that the term ""nuisance flooding"" and other terms be used in place of terms such as sea level rise, climate change and global warming, prompting allegations of climate change denial, specifically against Governor Rick Scott.  This amid Florida, specifically South Florida and the Miami metropolitan area being one of the most at risk areas in the world for the potential effects of sea level rise, and where the frequency and severity of tidal flooding events increased in the 21st century.  The issue is more bipartisan in South Florida, particularly in places like Miami Beach, where a several hundred million dollar project is underway to install more than 50 pumps and physically raise roads to combat the flooding, mainly along the west side of South Beach, formerly a mangrove wetland where the average elevation is less than one meter (3.3 feet).  In the Miami area, where the vast majority of the land is below 10 ft , even a one-foot increase over the average high tide can cause widespread flooding.  The 2015 and 2016 king tide event levels reached about 4 ft MLLW, 3 ft above mean sea level, or about 2 ft NAVD88, and nearly the same above MHHW.  While the tide range is very small in Miami, averaging about 2 ft , with the greatest range being less than 2 m , the area is very acute to minute differences down to single inches due to the vast area at low elevation.  NOAA tide gauge data for most stations shows current water level graphs relative to a fixed datum, as well as mean sea level trends for some stations.  During the king tides, the local Miami area tide gauge at Virginia Key shows levels running at times 1 ft or more over datum.

Title: Education in Bhutan
Body: Western-style education was introduced to Bhutan during the reign of Ugyen Wangchuck (1907–26).  Until the 1950s, the only formal education available to Bhutanese students, except for private schools in Ha and Bumthang, was through Buddhist monasteries.  In the 1950s, several private secular schools were established without government support, and several others were established in major district towns with government backing.  By the late 1950s, there were twenty-nine government and thirty private primary schools, but only about 2,500 children were enrolled.  Secondary education was available only in India.  Eventually, the private schools were taken under government supervision to raise the quality of education provided.  Although some primary schools in remote areas had to be closed because of low attendance, the most significant modern developments in education came during the period of the First Development Plan (1961–66), when some 108 schools were operating and 15,000 students were enrolled (see Role of the Government, this ch.)

Title: Education in the British Virgin Islands
Body: Education in the British Virgin Islands is largely free and is a requirement for children ages 5 to 17.  The British Virgin Islands has a total of 15 public primary schools and 4 secondary public schools.  In addition to the public schools, there are 10 primary private schools and 3 secondary private schools.  The School year is from September to June.  The British Virgin Islands is a part of the British Overseas Territories and therefore the educational system is very similar to the traditional learning system in the United Kingdom.  Primary schools are focused on establishing the basics of an academic curriculum and host students between the ages of 5 to 12.  After the completion of Primary school, students move on to Secondary school.  Secondary school is for students between the ages of 13 and 17.  Following the completion of secondary education, students may write their Caribbean secondary education certificate examination.  There are approximately 2,700 students who attend primary school for the first 7 years of their required education, however less than 1,800 students successfully finish the following 5 required years of secondary school and complete their certificate exam.  Tertiary Education is by no means required in the British Virgin Islands.  Students who chose to continue their education after Secondary Education may move on to an additional 2 years of schooling.  After 2 years of Tertiary Education is completed, students may take their Caribbean advanced placement examinations.  Passing the exams entitles students the right to continue their studies even further at the University of the Virgin Island.  This University is the only tertiary education institution in the British Virgin Islands.  At the University, students can obtain associate, bachelors, and master's degrees in the departments of business, education, liberal arts and social sciences, or science and mathematic.

Body: The 2002 Gran Premio Telmex-Gigante was the nineteenth and final round of the 2002 CART FedEx Champ Car World Series season, held on November 17, 2002 at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City, Mexico.  It was the first Champ Car race at the track since the 1981 season.  The race preceded a mass exodus of significant drivers and teams who all competed in their final Champ Car event, most of whom knew beforehand that they would not return.  Most rued the fact that they were leaving for the rival Indy Racing League, wishing to continue in CART rather than endure a more stable future in the IRL.  CART's winningest driver (42 wins), Michael Andretti, along with Kenny Brack, Scott Dixon, Dario Franchitti, Tony Kanaan, and Japan's most successful driver in U.S. open wheel racing Tora Takagi would all bid CART adieu in favor of the IRL.  Other entities leaving CART included 1996-1999 champions Chip Ganassi Racing, 1995 champions Team KOOL Green, and Mo Nunn Racing permanently switched to the IRL, and Japanese automotive industry giants Honda and Toyota likewise left CART for the IRL.

Despite 2 seasons with relative success, the series folded at the end of the 1996 season, again leaving Franchitti without a drive.

Title: Victor Johnston
Body: Victor S. Johnston (born 4 May 1943) is a prominent Irish-born psychologist whose work emphasis is emotion, and event related potentials.  His areas of study include cognitive engineering, biopsychology, and cognitive psychology.  His major research interests are evolutionary psychology, electrophysiology and genetic algorithms.  Dr. Johnston states, ""The human brain did not evolve to accurately represent the world around us; it evolved only to enhance the survival of our genes.""  According to Johnston, the combination of emotions with symbolic thought produces meaning.  But with this capacity comes the ability to develop meanings for things that do not exist.  Little girls develop the ability to attach emotional feelings to dolls, and pretend that their toys live.  Little boys learn how to pretend to hunt and fight and attach emotions to them.  We learn feelings of desire, fear, and wonder by wandering to the limits of our play.  Imagination allows us to create technology, mathematics, and art, but with it can also come terrifying thoughts that could cause harm to us.  We grow to learn the difference between most of our thoughts and what they represent, but most of us get fooled into believing the reality of some things that don't exist at all.

The memorable cover was done at M-G-M Pictures Studios in Culver City by artist Russ Gale.  From the album a single of ""Let There Be Love"" and ""You're Nearer"" was shipped to radio stations.  Then, by public demand, a single of ""You're My Everything"" and ""You're Nearer"" was released.  This album offered Joni's second recording of ""Let There Be Love,"" which had been released in an earlier version in 1952 as her first single on Sharp Records in Chicago, then going to M-G-M Records for further distribution.  Both recordings were arranged and conducted by Lew Douglas.  ""Let There Be Love"" went to the top of the album charts and was the sixth-best-selling album of 1953.  In 1956 the album was reissued as a 12-inch L.P. and in three single EPs; there was no EP set including the entire album.  For this release, four Joni James singles were added, but one of them had never been released.  That was ""I Need You Now,"" which was to have followed the hit ""My Love, My Love"" but was canceled when Eddie Fisher came out with a version recorded several weeks after Joni's.  M-G-M had expected Joni's original version to go straight to #1.  For the new album the first four songs and second four songs were switched to get ""You're My Everything"" in the outside groove of the L.P. to facilitate disc jockey play.  So, for 50 years, the story the album tells has been garbled.  In 1961 the album got new cover art, a new serial number (E3931), and an electronically simulated stereo release.  Released again on compact disk with yet more bonus tracks, the album is in its fifth decade as a best seller.  Joni James hopes for yet another release which will restore the original song order.  Significantly, for her last M-G-M album, ""Bossa Nova Style"", Joni included new recordings of several songs from ""Let There Be Love"", including a new single of ""You're Nearer.""  That album was arranged by Lew Douglas's protégé Chuck Sagle.  This information comes from Wayne Brasler, longtime President of the Joni James International Fan Club and the writer of the album notes for all Joni James' CD releases.

Prior to the Civil War, the highest rank reached by a Hispanic-American in the U.S. Navy was Commodore.  Such was the case of Commodore Uriah Phillips Levy (1792–1862), a Sephardic Jew of Hispanic descent and great grandson of Dr. Samuel Nunez, who served in the War of 1812.  During the American Civil War, the government of the United States recognized that the rapid expanding Navy was in need of admirals therefore, Congress proceeded to authorize the appointment of nine officers the rank of rear admiral.  On July 16, 1862, Flag Officer David Glasgow Farragut became the first Hispanic-American to be appointed to the rank of rear admiral.  Two years later (1864), Farragut became a vice admiral, and in 1866 the Navy's first full admiral.  During World War I, Robert Lopez, the first Hispanic graduate of the United States Naval Academy, served with the rank of commodore in command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, and during World War II five Hispanics served with the ranks of rear admiral or above in either the European or Pacific Theater's of the war.

Title: Open adoption
Body: Open adoption is a form of adoption in which the biological and adoptive families have access to varying degrees of each other's personal information and have an option of contact.  In Open Adoption, the adoptive parents hold all the rights as the legal parents, yet the individuals of the biological and adoptive families may exercise the option to open the contact in varying forms: from just sending mail and/or photos, to face-to-face visits between birth and adoptive families.

Title: Forced adoption in Australia
Body: Forced adoption was the practice of taking the babies from unmarried mothers, against their will, and placing them for adoption.  Former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard offered a national apology to those affected by forced adoptions in 2013.  The Australian Senate Inquiry Report into Forced Adoption Practices found that babies were taken illegally by doctors, nurses, social workers and religious figures, sometimes with the assistance of adoption agencies or other authorities, and adopted to married couples.  Some mothers were coerced, drugged and illegally had their consent taken.  Many of these adoptions occurred after the mothers were sent away by their families 'due to the stigma associated with being pregnant and unmarried'.  The removals occurred predominately in the second half of the twentieth century.  It was a practice which has been described as 'institutionalised baby farming'.

Source #3:
Title: Sixties Scoop
Body: The term Sixties Scoop refers to the practice of taking (""scooping up"") children of Aboriginal peoples in Canada from their families for placing in foster homes or adoption beginning in the 1960s and continuing to this day.  Provincially, each region had their specific adoption or fostering program and policy.  For example, Saskatchewan had the Adopt Indian Metis (AIM) Program.  The children were typically placed for adoption or fostering in Canada though a few were placed in the United States or western Europe.  The term ""Sixties scoop"" was coined by Patrick Johnston in his 1983 report ""Native Children and the Child Welfare System"".  It is a variation of the broader term Baby Scoop Era to refer to the period from the late 1950s to 1980s when large numbers of children were taken from their parents for adoption.  However and henceforth, the continued practice of taking Indigenous, Inuit and Metis children from their families for placing in foster homes or adoption is termed Millennium Scoop

Title: Adoption of Children Act 1949
Body: The Adoption of Children Act 1949 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  This legislation liberalised various rules concerning adoption.  Placement of children for adoption came under the supervision of local authorities, while adopted children were given inheritance rights.  In addition, the legislation also rejected the notion, implied in the Children Act of 1926, that the mother had to know the identity of the adopter if she could reasonably give consent to adoption.  The Act instead allowed the identity of the adopter to be concealed behind a serial number.  The act was repealed on 5 November 1993.

After the regulations on adoption procedure were sharply criticised, law in this area was reformed with the Adoption Act 1976, which repealed the 1958 Act.

Source #9:
Title: Adoption (theology)
Body: Adoption, in Christian theology, is the admission of a believer into the family of God.  In the evangelical ""ordo salutis"" (""order of salvation""), adoption is usually regarded as a step immediately subsequent to justification.  As a theological word, adoption has similar connotations to the act of legally placing a child with a parent or parents other than those to whom they were born.  There are three references in the New Testament to God ""adopting"" Christians as his own children (Galatians 4:5, Romans 8:15 and Ephesians 1:5) and one reference to the adoption by God, of the ""people of Israel"" (Romans 9:4).  Adoption as a theological term introduces a relational dimension to the consequences of Salvation.  Adoption as a theological concept is also another consequence of the 'legal' act of justification, alongside redemption and reconciliation.  The Old Testament precedent for this term comes from the story of Mephibosheth, who despite not being part of Davidic family was included in the Royal inheritance (2 Samuel 9:7-13).  Adoption was an important feature of Reformation theology as demonstrated by article 12 of the Westminster Confession of Faith:

CCAI seeks to educate and inform Members of Congress in adoption, foster care, and child welfare issues that affect their constituents.  This is done through congressional briefings, leadership training programs, educational trips, and other notable programs.  The Institute's work is entirely funded by donations and gifts from organizations and individuals like the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.

Title: Diplomatic mission
Body: A diplomatic mission or foreign mission is a group of people from one state or an organisation present in another state to represent the sending state/organisation officially in the receiving state.  In practice, a diplomatic mission usually denotes the resident mission, namely the embassy, which is the office of a country's diplomatic representatives in the capital city of another country, whereas consulates are diplomatic missions which are not performed in the capital of the receiving state.  As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries.  There are thus resident and non-resident embassies.

Additionally, a diplomatic bag usually has some form of lock and/or tamper-evident seal attached to it in order to deter or detect interference by unauthorized third parties.  The most important point is that as long as it is externally marked to show its status, the ""bag"" has diplomatic immunity from search or seizure, as codified in article 27 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  It may only contain articles intended for official use.  It is often escorted by a diplomatic courier, who is similarly immune from arrest and detention.

Title: History of cryptography
Body: Cryptography, the use of codes and ciphers to protect secrets, began thousands of years ago.  Until recent decades, it has been the story of what might be called classic cryptography — that is, of methods of encryption that use pen and paper, or perhaps simple mechanical aids.  In the early 20th century, the invention of complex mechanical and electromechanical machines, such as the Enigma rotor machine, provided more sophisticated and efficient means of encryption; and the subsequent introduction of electronics and computing has allowed elaborate schemes of still greater complexity, most of which are entirely unsuited to pen and paper.

Title: Settlement of the Americas
Body: Available scientific evidence indicates that modern humans emerged from Africa over 100,000 years ago, yet did not arrive in the Americas until less than 20,000 years ago.  Current understanding of the settlement of the Americas derives from advances in four interrelated disciplines: archaeology, Pleistocene geology, physical anthropology, and DNA analysis.  While there is general agreement that the Americas were first settled from Asia, the pattern of migration, its timing, and the place(s) of origin in Asia of the peoples who migrated to the Americas remain unclear.  In the 2000s, researchers sought to use familiar tools to validate or reject established theories, such as Clovis first.  The archeological evidence suggests that the Paleo-Indians' first dispersal into the Americas occurred near the end of the last glacial period or, more specifically, what is known as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), around 16,500–13,000 years ago.

Since the 1960s, there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and others targeting the more prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the Cleveland Indians and the Washington Redskins.  However, the greatest change has occurred in the trend by school and college teams that have retired Native American names and mascots at an increasing rate in recent decades.  The analysis of a database in 2013 indicates that there are currently more than 2,000 secondary schools with mascots that reference Native American culture, compared to around 3,000 fifty years ago.  Many of these changes have been voluntary as the issue has been discussed at a local level.  Statewide laws or school board decisions mandating change have been passed in states with significant Native American populations.  Other states have official policies that encourage change in accordance with principles of establishing a proper environment for education.  However, there has also been resistance and backlash.

Title: The Human Revolution (human origins)
Body: ""The Human Revolution"" is a term used by archaeologists, anthropologists and other specialists in human origins; it refers to the spectacular and relatively sudden – apparently revolutionary – emergence of language, consciousness and culture in our species.  The term came into fashion following a conference on human origins held in the late 1980s, resulting in a 1989 edited volume entitled ""The Human Revolution"", edited by archaeologist Paul Mellars and palaeontologist Chris Stringer.  In this early version, the rapid process of change was identified as the so-called 'Upper Palaeolithic Revolution' which occurred in Ice Age Europe around 40,000 years ago, resulting in the displacement of the local Neanderthals by anatomically modern ""Homo sapiens"", with their sophisticated ivory tools, carved figurines and cave paintings.  More recently, archaeologists have come to realise that if we can speak of a 'human revolution' at all, it happened tens of thousands of years earlier, in sub-Saharan Africa rather than Europe.  This means that the revolution was inseparable from the emergence of modern ""Homo sapiens"" in Africa between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago.

Title: Catholic youth work
Body: The phrase Catholic youth work covers a wide range of activities carried out with young people, usually in the name of the Catholic Church and with the intention of imparting the Catholic faith to them and inviting them to practice and live out the faith in their lives.  Activities in the field range from small scale youth groups attached to parishes or Catholic schools, to large international gatherings, such as World Youth Day.  It is a field which has evolved much over recent decades, especially in comparison to more formal methods of education or catechesis within the church.  Nearly all dioceses and a great deal of parishes have some form of youth provision running, although a great deal of areas particularly in the developed world are finding youth work both more difficult and rare as the numbers of young people regularly practicing the Catholic faith continue to decline.  In contrast, though, the new and exciting developments of recent decades and particularly the influence of the new movements within the Church are ensuring that youth work continues to be an active and fruitful field.

Title: Evolution of insects
Body: The most recent understanding of the evolution of insects is based on studies of the following branches of science: molecular biology, insect morphology, paleontology, insect taxonomy, evolution, embryology, bioinformatics and scientific computing.  It is estimated that the class of insects originated on Earth about 480 million years ago, in the Ordovician, at about the same time terrestrial plants appeared.  Insects evolved from a group of crustaceans.  The first insects were land bound, but about 400 million years ago in the Devonian period one lineage of insects evolved flight, the first animals to do so.  The oldest definitive insect fossil, ""Rhyniognatha hirsti"", is estimated to be  396 .  Global climate conditions changed several times during the history of Earth, and along with it the diversity of insects.  The Pterygotes (winged insects) underwent a major radiation in the Carboniferous (356 to 299 million years ago) while the Endopterygota (insects that go through different life stages with metamorphosis) underwent another major radiation in the Permian (299 to 252 million years ago).

Title: History of the United States
Body: The date of the start of the history of the United States is a subject of debate among historians.  Older textbooks start with the arrival of Christopher Columbus on October 12, 1492 and emphasize the European background of the colonization of the Americas, or they start around 1600 and emphasize the American frontier.  In recent decades American schools and universities typically have shifted back in time to include more on the colonial period and much more on the prehistory of the Native Americans.

Body: Richard G. Klein (born April 11, 1941) is a Professor of Biology and Anthropology at Stanford University.  He is the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences.  He earned his PhD at the University of Chicago in 1966, and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in April 2003.  His research interests include paleoanthropology, Africa and Europe.  His primary thesis is that modern humans evolved in East Africa some 100,000 years ago and, starting 50,000 years ago, began spreading throughout the non-African world, replacing archaic human populations over time.  He is a critic of the idea that behavioral modernity arose gradually over the course of tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years or millions of years, instead supporting the view that modern behavior arose suddenly in the Upper Paleolithic revolution around 50,000 or 40,000 years ago.

Title: Participant observation
Body: Participant observation is one type of data collection method typically used in qualitative research.  It is a widely used methodology in many disciplines, particularly cultural anthropology and (European) ethnology, less so in sociology, communication studies, human geography and social psychology.  Its aim is to gain a close and intimate familiarity with a given group of individuals (such as a religious, occupational, sub cultural group, or a particular community) and their practices through an intensive involvement with people in their cultural environment, usually over an extended period of time.  The method originated in the field research of social anthropologists, especially Bronisław Malinowski and his students in Britain, the students of Franz Boas in the United States, and in the later urban research of the Chicago School of sociology.

Title: Muted group theory
Body: Muted group theory (MGT) is developed by social anthropologists Edwin Ardener and Shirley Ardener in 1975.  The theory describes the relationship between a dominant group and its subordinate group(s): As the dominant group contributes mostly to the formulation of the language system, including the norms and vocabulary, members from the subordinate group have to learn and use the dominant-made language to express themselves.  However, this translation process may result in loss and distortion of information as the people from subordinate groups cannot articulate their ideas clearly.  The dominant may also ignore the voice of the lower-power.  All these may eventually lead to the mutedness of the subordinate group.  Although this theory is initially developed to study the different situations faced by women and men, it can also be applied to any marginalized group that is muted by the inadequacies of their languages.

The book has been described as Malinowski's ""magnum opus"".

As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail.  However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself.  Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail.  The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him.  Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail.

In 1828 the meeting house was rotated and moved, nearly to its present location, and the Greek Revival temple front with Doric columns was added, as was the tower and steeple.  These alterations were supposedly inspired by the recent (1817–18) construction of the Third Fitzwilliam Meetinghouse.  In 1859-60 the church was again moved, this time a short distance to make room for an enlarged sanctuary, as designed by the Worcester firm of Boyden & Ball.  The building exterior has been little altered since; the steeple was recreated from photographs after the original was toppled by the New England Hurricane of 1938.

Title: Conscription in the United States
Body: Conscription in the United States, commonly known as the draft, has been employed by the federal government of the United States in four conflicts: the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including both the Korean and Vietnam Wars).  The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act.  It was the country's first peacetime draft.  From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means.  The draft was ended when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force.  However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed.

Title: Franklin D. Roosevelt's record on civil rights
Body: In June 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which created the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC).  It was the most important federal move in support of the rights of African-Americans between Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The President's order stated that the federal government would not hire any person based on their race, color, creed, or national origin.  The FEPC enforced the order to ban discriminatory hiring within the federal government and in corporations that received federal contracts.  Millions of blacks and women achieved better jobs and better pay as a result.  The war brought the race issue to the forefront.  The Army and Navy had been segregated since the Civil War.  But by 1940, the African-American vote had largely shifted from Republican to Democrat, and African-American leaders like Walter Francis White of the NAACP and T. Arnold Hill of the Urban League had become recognized as part of the Roosevelt coalition.  In June 1941, at the urging of A. Philip Randolph, the leading African-American trade unionist, Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the Fair Employment Practice Committee and prohibiting discrimination by any government agency, including the armed forces.  In practice the services, particularly the Navy and the Marines, found ways to evade this order — the Marine Corps remained all-white until 1942.  In September 1942, at Eleanor's instigation, Roosevelt met with a delegation of African-American leaders, who demanded full integration into the forces, including the right to serve in combat roles and in the Navy, the Marine Corps and the United States Army Air Forces.  Roosevelt agreed, but then did nothing to implement his promise.  It was left to his successor, Harry S. Truman, to fully desegregate the armed forces.

Ireland"" which struck down as unconstitutional a seventy-year-old provision on statutory rape.  The Act provides for a defence of honest mistake where, if a defendant can satisfy the court that he or she honestly believed that the person with whom the sexual activity was committed, was of consenting age at the time (which the Act now sets as seventeen years old for both sexes).

Justice Holmes wrote that a patient may be sterilized ""on complying with the very careful provisions by which the act protects the patients from possible abuse.""  Between 1924 and 1979, Virginia sterilized over 7,000 individuals under the act.  The act was never declared unconstitutional; however, in 2001, the Virginia General Assembly passed a joint resolution apologizing for the misuse of ""a respectable, 'scientific' veneer to cover activities of those who held blatantly racist views.""  In 2015, the Assembly agreed to compensate individuals sterilized under the act.

Title: Taint (legal)
Body: Taint is a term used in the legal field with reference to evidence that has been ""tainted"" or ruined in some manner.  The most common of such usage is with reference to evidence, testimony, identification by witnesses, or confessions that have been obtained by law enforcement illegally.  The illegality usually results from a violation of one's constitutional rights, such as a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution protecting against unreasonable search and seizure.  For example, the dissent in the Supreme Court decision of ""Missouri v. Seibert"" stated that ""the court must examine whether the taint dissipated through the passing of time ... .""""  Missouri v. Seibert"", 542 U.S. 600, 628 (U.S. 2004) (Justice O'Connor Dissent, emphasis added).  The court in ""Wong Sun v.

United States"" (1957), which was a key Supreme Court ruling on freedom of sexual expression.  The minority opinion, regarding redeeming social value as a criterion in obscenity prosecutions, became a template for the liberalizing First Amendment decisions of the 1960s.

Title: Kois v. Wisconsin
Body: Kois v. Wisconsin, 408 U.S. 229 (1972) , was a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of the obscenity conviction of Milwaukee editor-publisher John Kois, whose underground newspaper ""Kaleidoscope"" had published two small photographs of pictures of nudes and a sexually-oriented poem entitled ""Sex Poem"" in 1968.  The Supreme Court ruled that, in the context in which they appeared, the photographs were rationally related to a news article which they illustrated and were thus entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection, and that the poem ""bears some of the earmarks of an attempt at serious art"" (whether successful or not), and thus was not obscene under the ""Roth v. United States"" test (""whether or not the 'dominant' theme of the material appeals to prurient interest"").  In the words of the concurring opinion of Justice William O. Douglas, ""In this case, the vague umbrella of obscenity laws was used in an attempt to run a radical newspaper out of business and to impose a two-year sentence and a $2,000 fine upon its publisher.  If obscenity laws continue in this uneven and uncertain enforcement, then the vehicle has been found for the suppression of any unpopular tract.  The guarantee of free expression will thus be diluted and in its stead public discourse will only embrace that which has the approval of five members of this Court.""

Title: Production of antibiotics
Body: Production of antibiotics is a naturally occurring event, that thanks to advances in science can now be replicated and improved upon in laboratory settings.  Due to the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming, and the efforts of Florey and Chain in 1938, large-scale, pharmaceutical production of antibiotics has been made possible.  As with the initial discovery of penicillin, most antibiotics have been discovered as a result of happenstance.  Antibiotic production can be grouped into three methods: natural fermentation, semi-synthetic, and synthetic.  As more and more bacteria continue to develop resistance to currently produced antibiotics, research and development of new antibiotics continues to be important.  In addition to research and development into the production of new antibiotics, repackaging delivery systems is important to improving efficacy of the antibiotics that are currently produced.  Improvements to this field have seen the ability to add antibiotics directly into implanted devices, aerosolization of antibiotics for direct delivery, and combination of antibiotics with non antibiotics to improve outcomes.  The increase of antibiotic resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria has led to an increased urgency for the funding of research and development of antibiotics and a desire for production of new and better acting antibiotics.

Title: Lewinsky scandal
Body: The Lewinsky scandal was an American political sex scandal that involved 49-year-old President Bill Clinton and 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky.  The sexual relationship took place between 1995 and 1996 and came to light in 1998.  Clinton ended a televised speech with the statement that he did not have sexual relations with Lewinsky.  Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives.  He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial.  Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in the Paula Jones case regarding Lewinsky and was also fined $90,000 by Wright.  His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the United States Supreme Court.

Body: Mary Elizabeth Day Nursery, also known as Mary Elizabeth Day Care Center, is a historic building located in Sioux City, Iowa, United States.  This is the oldest child day care facility in the state of Iowa, and the state's second-oldest preschool.  The Sioux City Day Nursery was established in 1914 by the Wall Street Mission, a local settlement house operated by the Methodist Episcopal Church.  They moved here in 1926, which is the first building designed as a day nursery in Iowa.  The two-story brick Renaissance Revival building was designed by local architect Jurgen A. Raven, and built by The Lytle Company, a Sioux City construction firm.  Parents were responsible for paying for at least part of their children's care, but it was also subsidized by religious institutions, private associations, and individuals.  During the Great Depression, both the federal and state governments began to fund and license child care.  The Works Progress Administration was involved in the 1930s.  A garage and playhouse designed by Sioux City architect Knute E. Westerlind was built in 1940, and it is part of the historic designation.  The facility was renamed the Mary Elizabeth Day Care Center in 1990.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

Clayton was born on September 12, 1955, at the U.S. Army Hospital in Fort Benning, Georgia.  Clayton was the oldest of six children, having one brother and four sisters, and was named after his father, Clayton Raleigh Fountain.  The family moved every 1½ to 2 years.

He recalled maternal responsibilities for cooking, ironing, serving, cleaning, and caring for his young siblings.  It was the male/paternal role, however, for which his father had carefully trained him.  While serving in the Marines, he was convicted of murdering his staff sergeant in 1974, while stationed in the Philippines.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and was ultimately sent to the United States Penitentiary, Marion, which was at the time the highest-security prison in the nation.  Fountain used his military training to murder three prisoners and one correctional officer with a homemade knife while serving time at Marion, and was labeled the ""Most Dangerous Prisoner"" in the federal system.

He recently joined the faculty of the University of Chicago.  He is best known for his discovery, on December 10, 2000, of Selam, also referred to as “Lucy’s child”, the almost-complete fossilized remains of a 3.3 million year old child of the species ""Australopithecus afarensis"".  The “world’s oldest child”, she is the most complete skeleton of a human ancestor discovered to date.  Selam represents a milestone in our understanding of human and pre-human evolution and contributes significantly to our understanding of the biology and childhood of early species in the human lineage; a subject about which we have very little information.  Alemseged discovered Selam while working with the Dikika Research Project (DRP), a multi-national research project, which he both initiated in 1999 and leads.  The DRP has thus far made many important paleoanthropological discoveries and returns to the field each year to conduct further important research.  Alemseged’s specific research centers on the discovery and interpretation of hominin fossil remains and their environments, with emphasis on fieldwork designed to acquire new data on early hominin skeletal biology, environmental context, and behavior.

Many other children, particularly younger children, attend nonacademic hagwon for piano lessons, art instruction, swimming, and taekwondo (태권도).  Most young children attend a hagwon.  Hagwon also play a social role, and many children, especially the younger ones, say they like going to hagwon because they are able to make new friends; many children ask to be sent because their friends attend.  There are many hagwon for adults too, such as flower arrangement and driving-license hagwon.

Its collapse can be avoided.

Title: Inquilabi Communist Sangathan
Body: Inquilabi Communist Sangathan was a Trotskyist organisation in India.  Formed through the merger of the Communist League and the Bolshevik Leninist Group, it was set up in 1984.  In the early years it had state units and members in ten provinces of India, and significant mass work.  From the 1990s, there was a decline, partly because many of its members were unable to do serious teamwork; and partly because the dogmatic style of Magan Desai, a powerful figure in the strongest state unit, Gujarat, clashed with other members who wanted a more open and non-sectarian functioning.  In addition, many ex-Stalinist and ex-Maoists were recruited, and one faction in West Bengal showed that they had simply replaced the Stalin-Mao cult by the Trotsky cult.  By the end of the 1990s, the ICS was a much shrunken organisation.  The final crisis came after the Gujarat carnage of 2002, when a faction around Desai attacked the most well-known anti-communal and civil rights activist members of the party as self-seeking individuals.  The Conference of 2003 saw Gujarat, led by Desai, rejecting a delegate session, so it was unclear how many members were actually in ICS.  The West Bengal unit, along with several Gujarat members, left.  It is uncertain whether Desai had an actual majority with him, but he continued to call his rump organisation ICS.  Their last public activity was a hostile intervention into the World Social Forum of Mumbai 2004.  Those who had split subsequently set up an organisation, Radical Socialist.

Source #1:
Title: Tonic water
Body: Tonic water (or Indian tonic water) is a carbonated soft drink in which quinine is dissolved.  Originally used as a prophylactic against malaria, tonic water usually now has a significantly lower quinine content and is consumed for its distinctive bitter flavour.  It is often used in mixed drinks, particularly in gin and tonic.

Source #2:
Title: Lydian cadence
Body: A Lydian cadence is a type of half-cadence that was popular in the Ars nova style of the 14th and early 15th century.  It is so-called because it evokes the Lydian mode based on its final chord as a tonic, and may be construed with the chord symbols VII♯ -I (if the final is taken as a Lydian-mode tonic) or III -IV (if the final is taken as a in major).  It is also the most common type of double-leading-tone cadence, as it contains two leading-tone resolutions (♯ - and - ).  A frequently-used type of Landini cadence is based on the Lydian cadence, with the upper voice dropping to before skipping back up to the tonic.

Source #3:
Title: Bittering agent
Body: A bittering agent is a flavoring agent added to a food or beverage to impart a bitter taste, possibly in addition to other effects.  While many substances are bitter to a greater or lesser degree, a few substances are used specifically for their bitterness, especially to balance other flavors, such as sweetness.  Notable beverage examples include caffeine, found naturally in tea and coffee and added to many soft drinks, hops in beer, and quinine in tonic water.

Source #4:
Title: Tequila and tonic
Body: Tequila and tonic, also known as TnT or Teqtonic, is a non-standard highball beverage.  The drink is made with a 2:1 ratio of tonic water to tequila and is served with lemon or lime wedges on ice.

Title: Sweet Melissa
Body: A Sweet Melissa is a gin-based cocktail that was named by its creator, Daniel Bouie, after his wife Melissa Chabran Bouie.  Sweet Melissa is made with gin, tonic water and a splash of Jack Daniel's in a short glass of ice.  Care must be taken not to add too much whiskey to this gin & tonic beverage.

Source #6:
Title: Tonality
Body: Tonality is the arrangement of pitches and/or chords of a musical work in a hierarchy of perceived relations, stabilities, attractions and directionality.  In this hierarchy, the individual pitch or triadic chord with the greatest stability is called the tonic.  The root of the tonic chord forms the name given to the key; so in the key of C major, the note C is both the tonic of the scale and the root of the tonic chord (C–E–G).  Simple folk music songs often start and end with the tonic note.  The most common use of the term ""is to designate the arrangement of musical phenomena around a referential tonic in European music from about 1600 to about 1910"" .  Contemporary classical music from 1910 to the 2000s may practice or avoid any sort of tonality—but harmony in almost all Western popular music remains tonal.  Harmony in jazz includes many but not all tonal characteristics of the European common practice period, sometimes known as ""classical music"".

Title: Gin and tonic
Body: A gin and tonic is a highball cocktail made with gin and tonic water poured over ice.  It is usually garnished with a slice or wedge of lime.  The amount of gin varies according to taste.  Suggested ratios of gin to tonic are between 1:1 and 1:3.

Title: Key (music)
Body: In music theory, the key of a piece is the group of pitches, or scale that form the basis of a music composition in classical, Western art, and Western pop music.  The group features a ""tonic note"" and its corresponding ""chords"", also called a ""tonic"" or ""tonic chord"", which provides a subjective sense of arrival and rest, and also has a unique relationship to the other pitches of the same group, their corresponding chords, and pitches and chords outside the group.  Notes and chords other than the tonic in a piece create varying degrees of tension, resolved when the tonic note or chord returns.  The key may be in the major or minor mode, though musicians assume major in a statement like, ""This piece is in C."" Popular songs are usually in a key, and so is classical music during the common practice period, around 1650–1900.  Longer pieces in the classical repertoire may have sections in contrasting keys.

Body: Grapico is a caffeine-free, artificially flavored carbonated soft drink with a purple color and a grape taste that is sold in the Southeastern United States.

Title: Anani ben Sason
Body: Anani ben Sason (also called 'Anani, 'Inani, and 'Inyani) was a Jewish Talmudist who lived in the Land of Israel, known as an amora of the third century, a contemporary of R. Ammi.  He rarely discussed ""Halakot"", and his discussions of them were not original (""Shab. "" 64b).  Once he recited a ""Halakah"" in the patriarch's mansion, without naming its author, which provoked R. Ammi to ask: ""Is it his own?  It is what R. Eleazar had reported in the name of R. Oshaiah"" (M. Ḳ.  24b).  In the ""Haggadah"", he sometimes reported the sayings of others, but more often he was original.  Thus, as a reason for the juxtaposition of the regulations regarding the sacrificial rites and the priestly vestments (""Ex. "" xxviii-xxix), he points out that the priestly vestments were to have atoning effects as well as the sacrifices.  He represents the miter as atoning for haughtiness, and cites R. Chanina as saying, ""That which rests highest on the priest atones for one's considering himself high""; and similarly with the rest of the priestly garments (""Zeb.""  88b; "" 'Ar.""  16a; compare ""Yer.  Yoma,"" vii.  44b; ""Lev.  R."" x.).  Referring to God's appearance in the thorn-bush (""Ex.""  iii.  2-4) he remarks, ""The Holy One—blessed be He! —said to Moses, 'When I will it, one of my angels stretcheth forth his hand from heaven and reacheth to the ground,' as the Scripture says [""Ezek. "" viii.  3], 'He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of mine head'; and when it so pleaseth me, I make three angels sit under one tree [""Gen."" xviii.  4]; when I choose, my glory fills the universe, as it is written [""Jer.""  xxiii.  24], 'Do I not fill heaven and earth?  saith the Lord'; 'and when I so willed, I spoke to Job in a whirlwind, as it is said [""Job,"" xxxviii.  1, xl.  6], ""The Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind"""" (""Ex.

Body: Sze Yap Cantonese (Chinese: 四邑廣東人; Sze Yap: Hlei Yip Gong Ong Ngin; Cantonese: Sei Yap Gwong Dong Yan; Mandarin: Sìyì guǎngdōng rén) are a Han Chinese group coming from a region in Guangdong Province in China called Sze Yap (四邑), which consisted of the four county-level cities of Taishan, Kaiping, Xinhui, and Enping.  Now Heshan has been added to this historic region, and the prefecture-level city of Jiangmen administers all five of these county-level cities, which is sometimes informally called Ng Yap.  Their ancestors are said to have arrived from what is today central China about less than a thousand years ago and migrated into Guangdong around the Tang Dynasty rule period, and thus Taishanese as a dialect of Yue Chinese has linguistically preserved many characteristics of Middle Chinese.

Title: Yixing Pumped Storage Power Station
Body: The Yixing Pumped Storage Power Station is a pumped-storage hydroelectric power station located Yixing city of Jiangsu Province, China.  Construction on the power station began in 2003 and the first unit was commissioned in 2007, the last in 2008.  The entire project cost US$490 million, of which US$145 million was provided by the World Bank.  The power station operates by shifting water between an upper and lower reservoir to generate electricity.  The lower reservoir was formed with the existing Huiwu Dam at the foot of Mount Tongguan.  The Yixing Upper Reservoir is located atop Mount Tongguan which peaks at 530 m above sea level.  During periods of low energy demand, such as at night, water is pumped from Huiwu Lower Reservoir up to the upper reservoir.  When energy demand is high, the water is released back down to the lower reservoir but the pump turbines that pumped the water up now reverse mode and serve as generators to produce electricity.  Water from the nearby Huangtong River can also be pumped into the lower reservoir to augment storage.  The process is repeated as necessary and the plant serves as a peaking power plant.  The power station is operated by East China Yixing Pumped Storage Co Ltd.

Title: Tea pet
Body: A tea pet, also known as a tea lover's pet, is a small clay figure which is kept by some tea drinkers for good luck.  The history of tea pets can be traced back to the Yuan dynasty (1206–1368).  They are usually made of ""zisha"" or Yixing clay, from the region near Yixing in Jiangsu province, China.  Just like Yixing teapots made of the same clay, tea pets are unglazed, so that they are mostly monochromatic with a rough surface.  Tea lovers in China raise a tea pet by placing it on the tea tray during tea time and pouring out the tea over it.  The most popular figure of the tea pet is the ""pee-pee boy"", which is used to judge whether the water is hot enough to make tea.  Tea pets are also molded into zodiac animals or Chinese mythical creatures such as dragons, Pixiu, Qilin, etc., to symbolize good luck, fortune and happiness, as well as historical or mythical characters such as Guanyin, Maitreya and Zhu Geliang.

Title: List of United States cities by area
Body: This list ranks U. S. cities by land area.  Total areas including water are also given, but note that, when ranked by total area, a number of coastal cities appear disproportionately larger.  San Francisco is an extreme example: water makes up nearly 80% of its total area of 232 square miles (601 km²).  Note also that in many cases a city may be geographically large primarily because its municipal government has merged with the government of the surrounding county.  In some cases the county no longer exists, while in others the arrangement has formed a Consolidated city–county (or city-borough in Alaska, or city-parish in Louisiana); these are shown in bold.  Cities that are not consolidated with or part of any county are independent cities, indicated thus <nowiki>**</nowiki>.  All data is from the 2010 United States Census.

Title: Laurentide Ice Sheet
Body: The Laurentide Ice Sheet was a massive sheet of ice that covered millions of square kilometers, including most of Canada and a large portion of the northern United States, multiple times during the Quaternary glacial epochs— from 2.588 ± 0.005 million years ago to the present.  The last advance covered most of northern North America between c. 95,000 and c. 20,000 years before the present day, and among other geomorphological effects, gouged out the five Great Lakes and the hosts of smaller lakes of the Canadian shield.  These lakes extend from the eastern Northwest Territories, through most of northern Canada, and the upper Midwestern United States (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan) to the Finger Lakes, through Lake Champlain and Lake George areas of New York, across the northern Appalachians into and through all of New England and Nova Scotia.  At times, the ice sheet's southern margin included the present-day sites of northeastern coastal towns and cities such as Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Boston, New York City, and Great Lakes coastal cities and towns as far south as Chicago and St. Louis, Missouri—and then followed quite precisely the present course of the Missouri River up to the northern slopes of the Cypress Hills, beyond which it merged with the Cordilleran Ice Sheet.  The ice coverage extended approximately as far south as 38 degrees latitude in the mid-continent.

Title: Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)
Body: The Kingdom of Croatia (Latin: ""Regnum Croatiae"" ; Croatian: ""Kraljevina Hrvatska, Hrvatsko Kraljevstvo"" ) was a medieval kingdom in Central Europe comprising most of what is today Croatia (without most of Istria and some Dalmatian coastal cities), as well as most of the modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The Kingdom existed as a sovereign state for nearly two centuries.  Its existence was characterized by various conflicts and periods of peace or alliance with the Bulgarians, Byzantines, Hungarians, and competition with Venice for control over the eastern Adriatic coast.  The goal of promoting the Slavic language in the religious service was initially brought and introduced by the 10th century bishop Gregory of Nin, which resulted in a conflict with the Pope, later to be put down by him.  In the second half of the 11th century Croatia managed to secure most coastal cities of Dalmatia with the collapse of Byzantine control over them.  During this time the kingdom reached its peak under the rule of kings Peter Krešimir IV (1058-1074) and Demetrius Zvonimir (1075-1089).
